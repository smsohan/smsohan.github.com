<div class="entry-content"><p>No matter which side of the table you&#8217;ve sat during interviews, you&#8217;ve
probably heard this question: <strong>&#8216;Why do you want this new job?&#8217;</strong></p>

<p>In the recent past, I&#8217;ve interviewed a few candidates and heard the
following answers so far:</p>

<ol>
<li>I&#8217;m not learning much on the current job after it&#8217;s been 2-4 years.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m looking for something that offers better work-life balance.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m not really looking for a job. The recruiters got in touch and I
thought I&#8217;d discuss.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m looking for more challenging work.</li>
</ol>


<p>All of the above are valid answers. I think there&#8217;s another perfectly
valid answer that candidates seldom mention probably due to the gravity
of the interview room situation. I&#8217;ve interviewed over a hundred
candidates across different companies and am yet to find anyone that
mentions: <strong>I am not happy with my current salary and benefits compared
to my skills</strong></p>

<p>Back to topic of answers. So, when someone answers that they are not
learning new things on the job, obviously, you&#8217;d be curios to know why
and how they have tried to change things. Unfortunately, most candidates
simply mention that they are doing repeat work and there&#8217;s not much to
learn doing the same thing over and over again. This is where I start
feeling a little uneasy. However, I understand that it&#8217;s a true
statement. If you&#8217;re in a similar situation, here&#8217;s some suggestion:
read books, and write code based on what you&#8217;ve read. Then, you can tell
a much convincing story that, I&#8217;ve forced myself to learn new things and
here&#8217;s some proof, but I really want to apply the newly learned skills
outside the scope of the &#8220;hello world&#8221; skills.</p>

<p>About work-life balance, I totally hear you. And if your current job
doesn&#8217;t suit what you need out of your life, it&#8217;s a perfectly valid
reason to look for new opportunities. However, make sure you&#8217;re able to
clearly set the expectation with your potential employer about what
work-life balance means for you. For example, if you can&#8217;t work over 40
hours a week, or must work from home one-two days a week, it&#8217;s best to
discuss this even before an interview starts to ensure you&#8217;re a good
match with the employer.</p>

<p>If you showed up at in interview just because a recruiter got in touch,
I&#8217;d say introspect first. It&#8217;s possible that on our subconcious mind you
have expectations that the potential of the new job offers you something
that you don&#8217;t get at the current job. So, instead of a passive asnwer
that the you simply acted based on the recruiter&#8217;s invite, it&#8217;s much
convincing to see if you can lay down one or two things that you expect
from the new job that you don&#8217;t get at the current job.</p>

<p>About looking for more challenge, it sounds like a cliche unless you can
share examples of work that is of challenging to you. May be you like
the challenge of using more complicated algorithms, may be you like
dealing with a lot of data, may be you like supporting production
emergencies, but there&#8217;s gotta be something that you can explicitly
mention as challenging. It helps employers to understand if they&#8217;re able
to provide you with enough challenge on the job.</p>

<p>Finally, if you&#8217;re looking for a new job because the current job isn&#8217;t
paying upto the level of your skills and contributions, make sure to
communicate it clearly as well. With salaries and benefits, I find it
much easier to work with people that know the actual $ figure that&#8217;ll
make them happy instead of beating around the bush to create confusions
all around. Just be confident and tell what makes you happy. If the
employer can afford it, most likely they&#8217;ll want to get you onboard as
a happy employee. If they can&#8217;t afford it, they&#8217;ll do their best. The
key here is to be explicit about what you want and be sure and confident
about it.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, when you walk into an interview it&#8217;s yours to lose. The
potential employer is investing their time and resources and would
rather have you hired than having to interview other candidates. As long
as you are able to justify why you want the new job, they&#8217;ll be quite
accommodating.</p>
