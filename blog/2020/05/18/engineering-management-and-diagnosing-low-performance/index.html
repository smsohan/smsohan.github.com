<div class="entry-content"><p>Beginning with a story here. Back in 2008, I was a couple of years out of college and working for a software company in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Like many of my classmates from my college, I was studying GRE alongside my job for a PhD admission in a reputable US university. That process being long and uncertain, I also applied for an MBA program at the University of Dhaka as a backup plan. The GRE preparation came in very handy and I qualified for the evening MBA program. I started MBA classes in January 2009 before the universities in USA and Canada made their decision on my application. There, I took a course on Management. I was too naive and still too much an engineer to pay attention.</p>

<p>But this image that our teacher drew on the board got stuck in my head to this day.</p>

<p><img src="/images/perf.jpg" alt="Performance" /></p>

<p>Fast forward ten years and I still like how cleanly it captures the essence of high performance of an employee as a combination of the employee&#8217;s ability and motivation in a suitable environment.</p>

<p>Given this is how high-performers are, it&#8217;s possible to plot a similar graph for low performers as a diagnostic report. If such a diagnosis is right, it can provide a valuable strategy for managers and employees to work towards improving employee performance. For example, if an employee lacks skill and motivation but fits very well within the work environment, a manager can focus on skills training and suggesting therapies to increase motivation. Similarly, if an employee is unable to acquire the skills for a particular job, focusing on motivation or changing the environment for that employee may not fix the low performance issue.</p>

<p>Based on the past 14 years of my time in the industry, I&#8217;ve shared some symptoms of low performance that I&#8217;ve seen. You can use this as an exercise sheet to plot your diagnosis of the low performer&#8217;s chart.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>New hire too slow to ramp up:</strong> You were impressed by a candidate during the interview. The same interview process was used to find many high performers in the past. But this employee is struggling to ramp up.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Knowledge vs. application:</strong> You have an employee who&#8217;s always studying job related skills and shows a great deal of interest in training, but can&#8217;t translate the knowledge into application.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Complains about the lack of time</strong>: You have an employee struggling to produce the best outcome. In your one:one meeting, the employee always complains about lack of time even after you give him/her the time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Frequently runs into conflicts:</strong> Your dream employee is causing too many conflicts within the team.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Can&#8217;t write thoughts down:</strong> You have an employee who&#8217;s unhappy about things. When you want them to write it down, they are unable to produce a crisp writeup about the problems and potential solutions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Doesn&#8217;t make hard decisions timely:</strong> You have a leader that stays away from making hard decisions. In their mind, they want someone else to make them take the hard decision.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isn&#8217;t aware of better ways to solve old problems:</strong> You have an employee who&#8217;s expert in certain ways of delivering work but lacks awareness of newer and more efficient ways.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Doesn&#8217;t take initiative:</strong> You encourage and reward employees to take initiatives that help the business. Yet, you see an employee is not taking part.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The good news is, once a diagnosis is accurate for such symptoms of low performance, you can move ahead and implement a concrete improvement strategy for your employee. The clarity of this simple method helped me in many situations.</p>

<p>I hope this helps you, too.</p>
