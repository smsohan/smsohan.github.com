Hello Readers:<br />Wish you all are doing great as the Spring already started :-)<br />Recently my grad courses are keeping me busy with assignments and projects as the term comes close to an end. So, I haven't had much time to spend on blogging other than posting the Ruby on Rails link blog called <a href="http://www.DrinkRails.com/">www.DrinkRails.com</a>. However, for my readers, I thought I would post the recent presentation that I put for the Agile course here:<br /><iframe frameborder="0" height="342" src="http://docs.google.com/present/embed?id=dghx8mpb_59chmh48hh" width="410"></iframe><br />But I am looking forward to start a new project with Wairever (<a href="http://www.Wairever.com/">www.Wairever.com</a>), a Calgary based health care IT solution vendor. I hope that will fuel me with a lot of new concepts and as always, I will try to keep my learning posted here at my blog. Stay tuned! BTW, if you are Ruby on Rails developer or wanna be so, please let me know your feedback about the DrinkRails.com link blog.</div>

So, what are these core principles? Well, most of you already know the phrase, "Inspect and Adapt". Now, you also know a bunch of specifications that facilitate this, for an instance, Scrum, XP etc.</div><div><br /></div><div>Reading the book, I had a realization that, its good to talk using concrete facts as much as possible. So, doing a <b>value stream mapping</b> practice is worth than spending hours in discussing the process optimization. The same holds true with the <b>Profit and Loss </b>statement when figuring out which option to take - quality compromise, deadline shifting or feature squeezing. Being able to answer <b>why </b>questions, at least 5 in a succession, is something very critical - then you know the hidden junk thats causing the bad smell. I highly recommend reading this book, especially to people who are doing agile for a year or so and thinking about getting better at it.</div><div><br /></div><div>I also had the opportunity to attend a speech by the authors on this Monday. The speech was a great one. But for my readers, I will write about an example from the speech.</div><div><br /></div><div>Once Mary and Tom visited a company that creates hardware and software tools for real time video conferencing. They met the Boss there and asked what they were doing. The answer was, "We are working to improve the system so that our customers get better video conferencing solution for their businesses." They went to a section where people were working on hardware and asked one what he was doing. The person replied, "I am creating a component for the system, so that our customers can do better video conferencing". Then they went to a software developer and asked what she was doing. She replied, "I am working to improve a part of the software so that our customers can do better video conferencing".... (I am sure Mary used better words than mine and it was really interesting to hear the story in her voice :-))</div><div><br /></div><div>So, the fact that she wanted to capture using this example is, although each individual is involved in a specific task, they envision the bigger picture from the customers' standpoint. This is really important. Because as soon as you start seeing the views from the customers' perspective, you will produce less bugs. In the book they mentioned, most software bugs are not results of coding/design errors, rather they arise from the difference in views among customers and developers.</div><div><br /></div><div>Overall, it was a pleasure to read the book, although this blog post may not reflect all of my respect and take home from the book :-(  </div><div><br /></div><div><br /><div><br /></div></div></div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
Ever since I started working in the software industry, as a freelancer or representing a company, I found the most challenging part of a remote software development project is "Communication". In agile setup, collaboration plays a leading role to be effective and efficient.<div><br /><div>By communication, I mean the following:-<div><ol><li>Getting the spec as intended by the client.</li><li>Asking specific questions on time.</li><li>Status update about progress, blocks and forthcoming events.</li><li>Getting feedback as intended by the client.</li><li>Making specific suggestions with rationale to the client.</li></ol><div>I am listing a few tools that I used and recommend others to use.</div><div><ol><li><b>A note pad:</b> I write down small bullet points as soon as I find a question/suggestion/idea.</li><li><b>Voice chat/telephone call:</b> It should be #1 preference. Its real time and most speedy after face-to-face. I use Skype for my voice calls and sometimes my phone as well.</li><li><b>IM</b>: I use GoogleTalk most of the time if it works with client. Otherwise, I just use the one that my client uses most frequently.</li><li><b>Collaboration tool: </b>I use <a href="http://scrumpad.com/">ScrumPad.com</a>. Post my messages, people get email notification and can directly reply on that notification. This way the collaboration is all captured in ScrumPad and we can also keep using Email.</li><li><b>A wire framing/drawing tool: </b>Sometimes a small sketch/piece of drawing may greatly ease the communication hurdle. I use MS Visio at times. However, I also use scanned copies of hand drawings and annotations. It works. However, I am looking for a good web based wire framing tool and I believe it will off-load a lot of decision confusions.</li><li><b>Desktop sharing tool: </b>Screen capture and desktop sharing also works for me. I use LogMeIn and Xing. These tools offer first class feedback capturing capability from remote clients.</li></ol><div>I also try to follow some general rules:</div><div><ol><li>Always have a prioritized list of points that I want to discuss.</li><li>Be on time.</li><li>Never stay disconnected for more than 3 business days.</li></ol><div>I am sure out-sourcing will keep growing in the coming days, not only for its low cost but also for the fact that they are getting smarter and equally competent as people who charge many folds compared to them. I also anticipate a lot of out-sourcing job will go to individuals or 2/3 person groups, may be not from fortune 500 companies, but there are still other unfortunate millions of companies who will need such small teams. If you plan to work remotely, I am sure you will need some of the above tools, and if you are already in the business and think you have other good tools, please share with me.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; ">This intro is from the presenters:-<br /><blockquote>PAS was a joint venture development initiative by 4 major oil and gas<br />companies and CGI. Devon, Encana, Husky and Talisman joined with CGI to<br />develop a new Production and Revenue Application. Each company put 3 senior<br />business resources on the project. The development component of the PAS<br />initiative cost $35M over 5 years with up to 90 people on the team. This<br />presentation is on how we used Agile to achieve this mammoth undertaking.<br /><br />The product is currently running in production at 5 major oil and gas<br />companies with great reviews. It is also in production for several mid and<br />smaller sized companies. CGI is currently marketing the product.</blockquote>This was my first ever meet with the <a href="http://www.calgaryagile.com/">Calgary agile methods user group, CAMUG</a> and it was a great experience. Off late, I have been looking for my graduate research topic on agile methods, especially around scaling agile beyond a single team and this was just a perfect session for me.</span><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">I noted down a few of their discussed topics that I would like to share with my readers:</span></div><div><ol><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; ">The project continued in dev mode for 5 years, a $35M project.</span><br /></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; ">It started with only 3 members and extended to a team of 90 following Scrum+XP.</span><br /></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">The project had 5 sponsoring companies or clients.</span></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">They had 6 teams working in the same sprint cycles.</span></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">In each team, there were significant members from the business working full time with the team onsite and in the same open-space arrangement.</span></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">They had some 3000+ unit tests and also 300+ acceptance test.</span></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">They automated all repetitive tests.</span></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">The had external experts visiting them from time to time. Eric Evans once visited them and helped them getting better grasp on Domain Driven Design.</span></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">There had been a $800K and one month deviation from the projected cost and timeline.</span></li></ol><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; ">They also discussed some issues related to working in a multi-team, multi-client project. I remember the following ones:-</span></div><div><ol><li>They had to balance between features/bug fixes.</li><li>The deployment was taken care of by the respective sponsors, not the teams.</li><li>They had issues with sprint backlog management.</li></ol><div>They highlighted some aspects with great emphasis:-</div><div><ol><li>Open communication is the key to success.</li><li>Onsite and full time real user availability is very important for such a big project.</li><li>Automated tests, partial pair programming and continuous integration is a big plus.</li><li>Staying co-located was really helpful.</li></ol><div>What about scaling beyond?</div><div><ol><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">I asked them, if they felt it would still be a similar success if there had been 12 teams or even more with 200 people or so. They said, it would be challenging.</span> But in response, they also said, following waterfall would make life much harder with such a big team, if at all it could be a success at the first place! Yes, I also believe this.</li><li>One of the audiences asked if they outsourced a part of the project and the response was 'No'. CGI has a big team in India with a very high CMM ranking, but the project manager and asst. project manager said, it would be much difficult for differing time zones. Also, it would be difficult to transfer the knowledge as well as replicate the value of onsite client presence. The development manager also added that, the cultural difference between an agile and CMM setup would also been an issue if they had to go for the off-shore team.</li></ol><div>The session was much more eventful than what I could compile. So, if you are anywhere near Calgary and interested about meeting agile practitioners from the industry, lets meet at the next meet! </div></div></div><div><br /></div></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; "> </span><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"> </span></div></div>

<p>Sighs!</p>  <p>Back then, on Friday, May 26, 2006, I was a final year undergrad student at <a href="http://www.buet.ac.bd/cse">CSE, BUET</a>. I was looking for a part-time software dev job opportunity and found a little one page advert for a student job at asha-technologies (lately renamed as <a href="http://code71.com/" target="_blank">Code71</a>). Visited their website and thought it might be worth giving a try!</p>  <p>As usual, I was interviewed over phone and enjoyed a long 2 hour interview on premise. I found it really inspiring and gained more interest towards the job after this session. I started waiting for a response… but was pretty certain about a positive one!</p>  <p>Good things happen in quick successions in our lives. Agree?</p>  <p>I agree. Because I just started a soul-journey with my soul-mate, Shahana, on the March of 2006. Then got the job offer on the 26th of May! Couldn’t be happier. A job for me during that time was just beyond its compensation, it was an inspiration, opportunity to see the real world and being part of something bigger than myself.</p>  <p><img height="214" src="http://photos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v3755/201/25/559702037/n559702037_2367230_3471408.jpg" width="222" /></p>  <p><em>Photo taken at Chhera dip (The Torn Island), St. Martins, Bangladesh. The last photograph taken with my first digital camera bought from my first month’s Salary!</em></p>  <p>I started my job on the 1st of June, 2006 at Asha-technologies. Asha-tech was still to find an office and <a href="http://syedraihan.com/" target="_blank">Omar</a> asked to meet him at his home office! That’s how it all started. We met a few times a week at Omar’s home until we moved to our office at the green building of green square at green road, Dhaka on the first of July.</p>  <p>Asha-tech signed up a client before it was even formed! So, once we moved into the office, we were building our first asha-tech product, an online loan financing gateway. We were enthusiastic about agile scrum/xp practices from the first day at office. The result was found in just less than 3 months. We rolled out our first release of the product. It was really a happy start. A fantastic start for a start-up. The client started generating revenue in less than 3 months of project inception!</p>  <p>The office setup was a small but adequate enough for our team. We installed long backup UPS (2 hours * 5 computers), A/C, IPS and dedicated internet connection with Wi-Fi. The work environment was full of fun. We were going for an outing to a team event every month and even more often going to delicious buffet places. We played table football and bowling… every time had a record breaking score and a new winner. We went swimming and believe me, <a href="http://syedraihan.com/" target="_blank">Omar</a> is as good a swimmer as he is a master in software technology. He would go to swimming with a flipper and flip like professional swimmers. He can even swim without using his hands/legs at all, lying side-on and in all such actions… I learned swimming keeping heads down and the easy way of breathing from him! Thanks!</p>  <p>Technologically we were maturing as well. Started using XPlanner for managing our project, attended daily standup meetings and started doing TDD. I won’t claim we got everything right at the first try… but, we were trying consistently, improving bit by bit… to this day.</p>  <p>For the most part, I was enjoying my job and became used to the pressure of a job + undergraduate studies. I said, good things happen in close succession. Another proof here! My first term final result with this job was a 4.0/4.0. I never scored 4.0 in a term before this nor had a 20+ hour/week job alongside my studies. </p>  <p>I strongly believe, my job taught me the attitude towards work, “plan, act and retrospect”. After over three years, I would suggest any new entrant in the software industry to start a career with passion. Its fun with passion. Its a win everyday with passion.</p></div>
