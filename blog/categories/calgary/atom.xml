I just completed my Winter 2010 semester at school. It was so far a good one. I pushed my papers and presentations on the courses of this semester at <a href="http://smsohan.com/#courses">http://smsohan.com/#courses</a>&nbsp;If you are interested to read my paper about <b>Tabletop Application Testing</b> or <b>Communication Challenges with Distributed Agile Teams</b>, you are most welcome at my site.<br /><br />However, its time to look ahead to the summer. And I hope this will be a good one! I just received my driving license after a wonderful training from Drashko and Gordana at the <a href="http://www.yellowpages.ca/bus/Alberta/Calgary/Green-Light-Driving-School/5369272.html">Green Light Driving School</a>. If you are looking for a caring and professional driving school in Calgary, I highly recommend them. They will make it easy for you.<br /><br />Well, driving license comes with an obligation to buy a car :-) I am right now looking for one used car, probably from Toyota, Honda or Nissan, as people told me these are more reliable than others. I am not sure if I will be buying a car soon, but I already got visa for a Europe trip, my first ever. Its gonna be our second honeymoon in the European land :-) We will be going to Norway for attending the XP 2010 conference where I will be presenting my research paper on <b>Email Auto-Tagging with User Stories</b>. However, we are planning to see a part of Amsterdam and Stockholm alongside Norway. I have heard all the good things about these sites during summer... staying tuned to that!<br /><br />I will also be working on my research project as well as my job at <a href="http://www.Wairever.com/">Wairever Inc</a>. This summer will be a busy one. But I am hoping the summer in Calgary will be a lot of fun with friends and at work...<br /><br /><b>One little realization:</b> I figured out that there are two crowds in the software world. One crowd has lot of respect for open source stuffs like <b>Ruby on Rails</b> and another crowd has that for "established" big players like <b>.Net or Java</b>. With this realization, I am focusing on getting my .Net knowledge in sync with recent developments as of <b>.Net 4.0 and VS 2010</b>. I am always reading the blogs and MSDN... but this time I will look into one/few books that give(s) a complete and detailed picture about the deltas in .Net 4.0. &nbsp;However, I will keep posting on my <a href="http://www.DrinkRails.com/">Drink Rails blog</a> as usual, almost daily.<br /><br />Do you have any recommended book for .Net 4.0? Please use the comments area for that.</div>

Thanks Ashic for stopping by and commenting... Yes, you are right, there are the four categories.</div>

Congrats on err...everything ;)<br />I&#39;d argue there are a few more types than just those two. There are .NET junkies who respect rails. There&#39;s a reason ASP.NET MVC is so great...some of those junkies saw that webforms is shit, that Rails does web far far better and chose to bring something similar to the .NET world. The same guys are promoting patterns and practices that came about partly (if not largely) from the Rails world. I&#39;m a .NET guy, so I know that that&#39;s true. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a fourth category that goes the other way (i.e. they&#39;re OSS people who respect .NET etc.).</div>

We relocated to the northwest section of Calgary, Alberta on the 26th August. I am new to this part of the world and traveling to this opposite time zone (GMT+6 to GMT-6) took around 33 hours. Did you ever take a flight on Qatar? Not? I recommend it. They offer best foods for your south asian delight. My route was Dhaka - Doha - London - Calgary. I enjoyed the trip (don't tell anyone, I was a bit scared when traveling over the Atlantic :-))<div><br /></div><div>The city of Calgary is really eye soothing green during this season. The little homes and lawns look fabulous in my eyes. People here celebrate the summer in style, you will see large family camping vans every now and then. So far the people here are also very friendly and welcoming towards new comers. It has been a good experience and hopefully coming days will be even better!</div><div><br /></div><div>On the 4th, I attended the graduate orientation program and met a lot of people. It was nice to know that the University of Calgary is equipped with all amenities required for an excellent graduate education. I am looking forward to use my free pass to the swimming pool! It'll be fun!</div><div><br /></div><div>I met my supervisor, Frank, and also people at my Lab. My next duty will be to select a topic for my research by the end of this year. But the earlier it is selected, the better it is. Let me know if you have a good idea on your heads around agile software process/tools or digital tabletops.</div><div><br /></div><div>My upcoming posts will be a mix of my graduate studies and my software related works. Also, I will be TAing and wish to share some of my teaching experience as well. Stay tuned!</div></div>
