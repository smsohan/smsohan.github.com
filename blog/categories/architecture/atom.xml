    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Continuing on this architecture series of posts. Similar to the <a href="/blog/2021/03/04/architecture-redis/">post on Redis</a>, this time let's focus on another hugely popular distributed database
called <a href="https://www.mongodb.com">MongoDB</a>. If you aren't familiar with MongoDB, it's a distributed database that allows you to store and query humongous amounts of JSON-like data.</p>

<p>To get an overview of MongoDB and its architecture, you can watch the following YouTube video:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oH-gQ4JdXQc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Of course, you can also download the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/collateral/mongodb-architecture-guide">official architecture guide</a> to learn more.
Let's focus on rationale behind MongoDB's architectural decisions. You can find answers to all of the following questions
if you went through the guide or the video. But my goal is get you to think about the why behind the decisions.</p>

<p>MongoDB has databases and collections. While collections are conceptually parallel to tables in traditional relational databases, MongoDB doesn't impose
any restrictions on the schema of a collection. Can you think of reasons behind this decision? What trade-offs come to your mind? For example,
not having a schema allows you to store anything within a collection, essentially reducing the need for schema migrations on very large databases.
But at the same time, it may complicate consumption of the data. What other trade-offs can you think of?</p>

<p>MongoDB uses a router named Mongos and needs config servers to route queries when data is sharded into multiple partitions. What benefits and challenges do you see with the addition of this router component?</p>

<p>MongoDB requires you to have an uneven number of replicas to deal with failover when a new primary node needs to be elected. How do you judge this design decision?</p>

<p>By design, MongoDB allows you to choose a write concern at write time to allow you to balance your need in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem">CAP</a> triangle. Can you explain what you must do
 to ensure you'll not lose data is 2 out of 3 of your replica servers were to go corrupt?</p>

<p>MongoDB allows you to run complex map-reduce queries in the form of aggregate pipelines. In a distributed database, which component within the MongoDB ecosystem
is responsible for aggregating data that spans multiple nodes?</p>

<p>If you followed the Redis post, what would you say are the top 3 architectural differences between MongoDB and Redis? Can you reason about the why behind the
differences?</p>

<p>Based on MongoDB's architecture, where do you see a potential bottleneck that can affect scaling a MongoDB cluster? What options do you have to workaround?</p>

    <id>http://smsohan.com/blog/2021/03/04/architecture-redis</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to the Software Architecture series. I know at least a few people from my team are following, and that's a great encouragement.</p>

<p>For today's post, let's focus on learning from a very popular and commonly used open-source project called <a href="http://redis.io">Redis</a>. To the developers, Redis is a
dead simple key-value store with a super simple API as follows:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<p>$ set today 'Thursday'
OK</p>

<p>$ get today
Thursday</p>

<p>$ set temp 20
OK</p>

<p>$ incr temp
21</p>

<p>$ incrby temp 3
24</p>

<p>$ get temp
24
```</p>

<p>Of course Redis has more advanced features, but not too many. I think Redis is a delightful system. It's fun to use and has a reputation for being incredibly fast and scalable. I'm going to recommend you to spend some time on <a href="https://docs.redislabs.com/latest/rs/concepts/">Redis architecture</a> and see if you understand the concepts to confidently answer the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why is Redis so fast?</li>
<li>What can you do to prevent data loss when using Redis?</li>
<li>How does Redis distribute its data to multiple nodes?</li>
<li>What happens when you add a new node to a Redis cluster?</li>
<li>What happens when you remove a node from a Redis cluster?</li>
<li>How does Redis allow you to have an even distribution of the data in your cluster?</li>
<li>How can you build resilience using Redis when a whole datacenter fails?</li>
<li>How does a Redis client discover which Redis server to go to?</li>
<li>How do you know if you have enough capacity in your Redis cluster?</li>
<li>How does Redis provide end-to-end encryption?</li>
<li>If a Redis cluster dies, how can you restore it?</li>
<li>What metrics would you use to monitor if your Redis cluster is healthy?</li>
</ol>


<p>My plan is to introduce you to a bunch of open-source systems like Redis and ask similar questions. The idea is, after going through a few of these systems, you'll start to see patterns and trade-offs for each. Being familiar with real-world systems and seeing the patterns in use, I hope you'll be able pick and choose the patterns that best fit your system requirements, environment, and people.</p>

<p>Happy learning!</p>

    <updated>2021-01-17T17:36:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://smsohan.com/blog/2021/01/17/software-architecture-part-3-writing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An architect first needs to write for herself, and then for her team. Let me explain a bit.</p>

<p>An architect takes the trio of requirements, people, and environment, and does her research to design the most delightful system. In her research process, she uses her past experience as well as the experience of others. Even a moderately complex system design involves a lot of trade-offs without clear winners. For example, given that there are tens of different databases one can choose, how can she recommend a specific one? Only a clear mind can produce a logically sound write-up. So, in the process of writing and rewriting her design rationale, an architect can strengthen the soundness of her own logic behind the choices made. This is also known as covering one's ass.</p>

<p>Secondly, an architect is a busy person and can't scale her time if she has to personally explain her design rationale to everyone. In fact, as she's designing the system and making certain assumptions, she must seek feedback from the team to help her find alternatives or blind-spots. Writing scales infinitely (e.g. J.K. Rowling), and after all, an architect must use a scalable system for herself, right?</p>

<p>In this episode, I have two all time great books to recommend, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-William-Strunk-Jr/dp/194564401X">The Elements of Style</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2CX22WLYQMRQ4&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=on+writing+well&amp;qid=1610987519&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=on+writing+%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C194&amp;sr=1-1">On Writing Well</a>. If you want to learn to write with a fascinating biographic story, I loved <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Memoir-Craft-Stephen-King/dp/1982159375/ref=pd_sbs_4?pd_rd_w=c3cVk&amp;pf_rd_p=3ec6a47e-bf65-49f8-80f7-0d7c7c7ce2ca&amp;pf_rd_r=4C1CJMPXT72EZ2Z0ZXAB&amp;pd_rd_r=8c477446-3402-4789-8332-0b508abb7812&amp;pd_rd_wg=TmVYV&amp;pd_rd_i=1982159375&amp;psc=1">On Writing (A Memoir of the Craft)</a> by Stephen King. Do yourself a favor and get these books. Even if you are a native English speaker, I recommend you reading these books to make your writing interesting. As you can imagine, these books on writing are fun read, it'd be quite an irony otherwise.</p>

<p>As promised before, this is my last soft-skills related post in the software architecture series. Only a few senior engineers will break the glass ceiling and become an architect. Fewer will become a great architect. All the great ones I've met had exemplary soft-skills.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To be an architect, you'll have to be a leader. And, to be a leader, you'll have to be able to understand people and create an influence on them. So, focusing on the people involved with a system is a pre-requisite for designing systems that delight them.</p>

<p>For this topic, I want you to read and internalize the ideas from the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Dale+Carnegie&amp;qid=1609523629&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a> by Dale Carnegie. Honestly, it's a fun read for anyone, not just for the aspiring architect. But an architect must be able to listen with empathy and clearly share her ideas. She needs to truly appreciate diverse opinion because it's common that a delightful system can be designed in many ways, and she's likely to have her blind spots. Moreover, she needs exceptional conflict-resolution skills to create a safe space so the best ideas win irrespective of where it comes from.</p>

<p>I know some of you may be getting impatient because you want to learn hardcore software architecture and I'm not talking anything technical yet. If you can hold your patience and bear with me, we'll get there soon enough. I have what I think an exciting curriculum where I'll be teaching hardcore software design topics using many well-known open-source products. My goal is to set you up for success as an architect, and these softcore topics are of the highest priority in my curriculum. The small number of great architects I've enjoyed working with have won me over by their people skills. All the other architects may have been technically genius, but lacked people skills to appreciate the essence of a delightful system, let alone designing one.</p>

    <link href="http://smsohan.com/blog/2020/12/26/software-artchitecture-part-1/"/>
    <updated>2020-12-26T15:07:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://smsohan.com/blog/2020/12/26/software-artchitecture-part-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>"I want to be an architect"</em> - is a common career goal I hear during one:one meetings and annual reviews with my team members. Honestly, I'm writing this series of blog posts to bring some clarity and structure into my own thoughts, and hopefully to scale my time. You can even say, I'm open-sourcing my mentorship on the topic of software archtecture. My sincere hope is, this series helps my team or anyone who wants to systematically learn and improve their software design skills.</p>

<p>My mental model of a software architect as a system is as follows:</p>

<pre>
                 _________
                |         |
Requirements -> |         |
                |         |
 Environment -> |Architect| -> "Delightful" System Design
                |         |
      People -> |         |
                |_________|
</pre>


<p>That is, they produce the most delightful system design as the output from three inputs: business requirements, the environment that surrounds the system, and the people that are involved with the system. The main phrase to remember is <strong>"the most delightful"</strong> - because this is what makes the architect's job so much fun and appealing.</p>

<p>First, I recommend reading the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654">The Design of Everyday Things</a> to learn how design impacts us everyday. It's a fun and must read for anyone involved in any kind of design.</p>

<p>Next, I recommend reading the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515/ref=sr_1_1?crid=EH17W0BAL06D&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=don%27t+make+me+think&amp;qid=1609281299&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=don%27t+make+%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C200&amp;sr=1-1">Don't Make Me Think</a> to learn about how to know if your design is delightful.</p>

<p>I prefer the word delightfulness over usability or customer obsession because the former sets a high bar. I hope you also internalize the goal of designing the most delightful systems and settle for nothing less, why should you?</p>
