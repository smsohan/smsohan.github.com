    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An architect first needs to write for herself, and then for her team. Let me explain a bit.</p>

<p>An architect takes the trio of requirements, people, and environment, and does her research to design the most delightful system. In her research process, she uses her past experience as well as the experience of others. Even a moderately complex system design involves a lot of trade-offs without clear winners. For example, given that there are tens of different databases one can choose, how can she recommend a specific one? Only a clear mind can produce a logically sound write-up. So, in the process of writing and rewriting her design rationale, an architect can strengthen the soundness of her own logic behind the choices made. This is also known as covering one's ass.</p>

<p>Secondly, an architect is a busy person and can't scale her time if she has to personally explain her design rationale to everyone. In fact, as she's designing the system and making certain assumptions, she must seek feedback from the team to help her find alternatives or blind-spots. Writing scales infinitely (e.g. J.K. Rowling), and after all, an architect must use a scalable system for herself, right?</p>

<p>In this episode, I have two all time great books to recommend, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-William-Strunk-Jr/dp/194564401X">The Elements of Style</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2CX22WLYQMRQ4&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=on+writing+well&amp;qid=1610987519&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=on+writing+%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C194&amp;sr=1-1">On Writing Well</a>. If you want to learn to write with a fascinating biographic story, I loved <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Memoir-Craft-Stephen-King/dp/1982159375/ref=pd_sbs_4?pd_rd_w=c3cVk&amp;pf_rd_p=3ec6a47e-bf65-49f8-80f7-0d7c7c7ce2ca&amp;pf_rd_r=4C1CJMPXT72EZ2Z0ZXAB&amp;pd_rd_r=8c477446-3402-4789-8332-0b508abb7812&amp;pd_rd_wg=TmVYV&amp;pd_rd_i=1982159375&amp;psc=1">On Writing (A Memoir of the Craft)</a> by Stephen King. Do yourself a favor and get these books. Even if you are a native English speaker, I recommend you reading these books to make your writing interesting. As you can imagine, these books on writing are fun read, it'd be quite an irony otherwise.</p>

<p>As promised before, this is my last soft-skills related post in the software architecture series. Only a few senior engineers will break the glass ceiling and become an architect. Fewer will become a great architect. All the great ones I've met had exemplary soft-skills.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To be an architect, you'll have to be a leader. And, to be a leader, you'll have to be able to understand people and create an influence on them. So, focusing on the people involved with a system is a pre-requisite for designing systems that delight them.</p>

<p>For this topic, I want you to read and internalize the ideas from the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Dale+Carnegie&amp;qid=1609523629&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a> by Dale Carnegie. Honestly, it's a fun read for anyone, not just for the aspiring architect. But an architect must be able to listen with empathy and clearly share her ideas. She needs to truly appreciate diverse opinion because it's common that a delightful system can be designed in many ways, and she's likely to have her blind spots. Moreover, she needs exceptional conflict-resolution skills to create a safe space so the best ideas win irrespective of where it comes from.</p>

<p>I know some of you may be getting impatient because you want to learn hardcore software architecture and I'm not talking anything technical yet. If you can hold your patience and bear with me, we'll get there soon enough. I have what I think an exciting curriculum where I'll be teaching hardcore software design topics using many well-known open-source products. My goal is to set you up for success as an architect, and these softcore topics are of the highest priority in my curriculum. The small number of great architects I've enjoyed working with have won me over by their people skills. All the other architects may have been technically genius, but lacked people skills to appreciate the essence of a delightful system, let alone designing one.</p>

    <link href="http://smsohan.com/blog/2020/12/26/software-artchitecture-part-1/"/>

    <id>http://smsohan.com/blog/2020/12/26/software-artchitecture-part-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>"I want to be an architect"</em> - is a common career goal I hear during one:one meetings and annual reviews with my team members. Honestly, I'm writing this series of blog posts to bring some clarity and structure into my own thoughts, and hopefully to scale my time. You can even say, I'm open-sourcing my mentorship on the topic of software archtecture. My sincere hope is, this series helps my team or anyone who wants to systematically learn and improve their software design skills.</p>

<p>My mental model of a software architect as a system is as follows:</p>

<pre>
                 _________
                |         |
Requirements -> |         |
                |         |
 Environment -> |Architect| -> "Delightful" System Design
                |         |
      People -> |         |
                |_________|
</pre>


<p>That is, they produce the most delightful system design as the output from three inputs: business requirements, the environment that surrounds the system, and the people that are involved with the system. The main phrase to remember is <strong>"the most delightful"</strong> - because this is what makes the architect's job so much fun and appealing.</p>

<p>First, I recommend reading the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654">The Design of Everyday Things</a> to learn how design impacts us everyday. It's a fun and must read for anyone involved in any kind of design.</p>

<p>Next, I recommend reading the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515/ref=sr_1_1?crid=EH17W0BAL06D&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=don%27t+make+me+think&amp;qid=1609281299&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=don%27t+make+%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C200&amp;sr=1-1">Don't Make Me Think</a> to learn about how to know if your design is delightful.</p>

<p>I prefer the word delightfulness over usability or customer obsession because the former sets a high bar. I hope you also internalize the goal of designing the most delightful systems and settle for nothing less, why should you?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Good design is obvious. Great design is transparent. â€” Joe Sparano</p></blockquote>

<p>Ruby on Rails delighted me all through my career. The community is one with a taste for art, thanks to DHH's ability to write well. He set a  high bar and the community also lives up to it. One API that absolutely blows my mind is how delightful it is to work with date and time in Ruby on Rails. Here are a few example use cases:</p>

<p>```ruby</p>

<h1>Schedule a report to run at the beginning of next week</h1>

<p>report.run_at = 1.week.from_now.beginning_of_week</p>

<h1>.. or first Friday of next month</h1>

<p>report.run_at = report.run_at.next_occurring(:friday) unless report.run_at.friday?</p>

<h1>.. or beginning of next month</h1>

<p>report.run_at = 1.month.from_now.beginning_of_month</p>

<h1>.. or mid-day tomorrow</h1>

<p>report.run_at = 1.day.from_now.at_midday</p>

<h1>Is today a weekday?</h1>

<p>Time.now.on_weekday?</p>

<h1>.. or a weekend?</h1>

<p>Time.now.on_weekend?</p>

<h1>Book a calendar event for a whole day</h1>

<p>time_off.duration = Time.now.all_day</p>

<h1>.. or find sales in the current quarter</h1>

<p>Sale.where(created_at: Time.now.all_quarter)...
```</p>

<p>A lot of time related code I've seen in real projects is finding a point in time relative to <code>now</code>. Ruby on Rails makes it an absolute joy traveling time by adding time related methods straight into the <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org">Integer</a> class, where the code looks just like how we think about time. Sure, Rails uses complex classes such as <code>TimeWithZone</code>, <code>Duration</code>, etc. under the hood, but I've almost never seen those used directly. This is such a stark contrast with many other platforms where you have to use pedantic concepts such as <code>TimeSpan</code>, <code>Calendar</code>, <code>GregorianCalendar</code>, etc. The true elegance of time travel API in Ruby on Rails lies in how invisible it is.</p>

    <link href="http://smsohan.com/blog/2019/11/17/how-about-full-stack-micro-services/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/patched_quilt.jpg" alt="patched quilt" /></p>

<p>I think nobody knows how to stitch together an app with full-stack micro-services. I have the following open-questions if you disagree. Of course, if we could send people to moon, we could solve these problems. But the question is, is it worth and should your team  solve these problems? Especially, for small teams?</p>

<ol>
<li>How to render the UI from tens of independent micro-services into the same web page?</li>
<li>How to ensure the JS and CSS libraries are compatible within all of the independent services?</li>
<li>How to aggregate logs from the services to be able to trace a user / request / transaction?</li>
<li>How to measure and reduce overall latency and spinner-fatigue?</li>
<li>Which off-the-shelf framework can be used for achieving the above?</li>
</ol>


<p>Headless micro-services are easy to build, but in many ways are similar to integration over database. It helps scaling teams, but even if you have many teams, I'd say extract service where it makes sense instead of adopting that model as the default choice.</p>

<p>I suggest being careful about following conference talks and blogs on how cool micro-services are. It may work for big and gig tech. They don't always turn a profit! Your small teams are more likely to drown in worthless complexity from a micro-service architecture.</p>
