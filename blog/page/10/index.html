I joined late for the program. So, by the time I went there, a massive amount of work has already been done, meaning a huge learning curve for me. On retrospect, I think I did well :)<br /><br />My team was small, 4-5 people including 3 devs. But we were responsible for really high value enterprise integration work, especially, linking the two most important applications in the program. This was a great place to learn some of the core business domain specific knowledge and I loved it!<br /><br />However, enterprise integration stuff is full of XML messaging and translation. While XSLT works when it works, in our situation we had too much logic and stateful data involved in the translation. So, we had to write a hell lot of custom code for all the XML messaging&#8230; and it sucks! Why?<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Service APIs change all the time!&nbsp;</blockquote>I was mostly writing Java at work in this project for the first time in my professional career. This was a big change as well as a good exposure, considering my recent work mostly being in C# and Ruby. &nbsp;In retrospect, I would say, I would rather not use Java, its a great platform but offers your an aging language.<br /><br />Being in the enterprise world means dealing with enterprise service buses, queues, oracle database, weblogic, load balancers, risk and compliance and you name it&#8230; sometimes the complexity of these things seemed to be&nbsp;unnecessarily&nbsp;troublesome, but then again, at times they made sense as well.<br /><br />People factors matter way greater than any other factor in such a big project. In retrospect, I think a hierarchical system often leads to longer meetings, useless communication and less ownership for most people.<br /><br />I will continue this post to a second episode where I will talk about development practices, challenges with multi-project communication, politics and power relations etc. Stay tuned!&nbsp;</div></div>

Nice, I too learned about the wonderfulness of parent divs being postion:relative and child divs being postion:absolute when I worked at Radio 3. After the eureka moment positioning didn&#39;t seem that hard anymore.</div>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">When using static programming languages such as Java, often time I have seen people writing methods that accept Object as a parameter. These methods typically don&#8217;t really work on any Object, but works with multiple types of classes that don&#8217;t have any common base class. Here&#8217;s an example of such a method:<br /><br /></div><script src="https://gist.github.com/1332622.js"></script>As you can see in this example, the <code>process</code> method actually expects one of <code>CleanFloor</code> or <code>LaunchRocket</code> instances. However, since the two don&#8217;t have a common subclass, it falls back to an Object type. And that results in the smelly code as you see in the example.<br /><br />An ideal solution would be to change the design of the classes so that you can either use a common base class or a generic method. But if you can&#8217;t just do that<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Get rid of the instanceof anyway!</blockquote><br />However, this doesn&#8217;t need to be smelly. Turning to basics of OO programming concepts, you will recall that there&#8217;s this thing called method overloading that is specifically there to solve this very problem.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1332647.js">  </script>It seems so obvious in this example that you might question, why someone would use the former code? Well, I have seen quite a few of them and if you search for instanceof in your Java project, I won&#8217;t be surprised if you see a few code fragments that match the former example. </div></div>

If you are integrating continuously, then you shouldn&#8217;t need a nightly build, that would be too discrete :(<br /><br />If you already have a per-commit continuous integration setup, you shouldn&#8217;t need the so called nightly build unless there&#8217;s something bad about the code.<br /><br />Often times, builds taking &gt;10 minutes are put in the bucket of nightly builds.<br />Some people put batch processing related tests under such nightly builds. A colleague told me they used nightly build to clean up resources (disk space, recreate the database etc.) on a nightly build - to ensure the apps worked fine on a fresh state.<br /><blockquote>Under most circumstances, a nighly build means something long running. That in itself can be an indication of poor performance.</blockquote>But what I have seen is, when such nightly builds are broken - they are rarely looked after or cared for. Because, first thing in the morning, who the hell wants to look at that broken nightly build? Even if someone takes a look, since its long running, it might well eat up all morning to actually try/fix/commit changes and see it go green again! Since it takes longer to make the build green, people keep delaying it for later&#8230; meaning<br /><blockquote>it becomes generally acceptable to let the nightly build stay in RED.&nbsp;</blockquote>And once people get used the redness of the nightly build, they start ignoring it, inevitably.<br /><br />So, here&#8217;s what I would do:<br /><blockquote>Avoid nightly builds altogether.<br />Avoid nightly builds altogether.<br />Avoid nightly builds altogether.<br />Otherwise, make one person from the team responsible for the build (rotate people).</blockquote><div><br /></div></div></div>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Often times, applications cannot get rid of the database records for business rules. For example, if you are a cable TV provider, you might have a customer calling you to stop the National Geographic Channel subscription from next month.&nbsp;Ideally you would like to delete this record, but you can&#8217;t do it until the effective date:( If you delete it, the next invoice will not be able to charge for this channel, although it&#8217;s still being used.<br /><br />In such scenarios, its common to fall back to a soft delete model. As an example, here&#8217;s a little code:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1249283.js">  </script><br />This code looks simple and harmless at a first sight. But, as you develop your app, you&#8217;ll run into a lot of issues from this. Here&#8217;s a short list:<br /><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>You need to take care of cascading soft delete, for example, cancelling a customer&#8217;s subscription needs to cascade down to all channels and other objects under it.</li><li>Whenever, you are listing the current subscriptions of a customer, you need to filter out the ended ones.</li><li>You need to figure out a strategy to periodically clean the ended subscriptions so that your database is not filled with outdated data.</li><li>If you have a business key used as a primary key as well, you will be in trouble if an ended subscription is restarted.</li><li>Your code will eventually have a lot of if-else blocks to apply changes to only on active objects.</li></ol>So, what is the solution? Its best to avoid them as much as possible. Richard Dingwall has <a href="http://richarddingwall.name/2009/11/20/the-trouble-with-soft-delete/">a detailed blog post</a> on some alternative techniques to avoid soft-delete. But if you have to have soft delete, as shown in the example, its worth remembering the aforementioned points.<br /><div><br /></div></div></div>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Private methods, when used meaningfully, are a great tool for writing beautiful object oriented code. But as many other things in life, excess of private methods is bad, too!<br /><br />In my opinion, we use private methods to:<br /><br />1. &nbsp;isolate a block of code to be reused inside the class.<br />2. &nbsp;extract code from another method for code readability.<br /><br />Now, taking these two use cases in mind, here&#8217;s an easy conclusion:<br /><blockquote>The lower the ratio of public to private methods, the harder it is to write unit tests since the &#8220;units&#8221; are potentially larger.</blockquote>I don&#8217;t know if there is any rule of thumb, but you will smell it when you see your unit tests require a lot of setup and assertions. Here&#8217;s a code example from the Play! framework, an MVC franework for Java developers.<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/playframework/play/blob/925a0676148f6cb149350f899a60d934544ab61a/framework/src/play/mvc/ActionInvoker.java">ActionInvoker.java </a><br /><br />You will see there are public methods with 100+ lines. I hope you agree with me:<br /><blockquote>&#8220;The ActionInvoker.java code is not readable&#8221;</blockquote>For the sake of readability, introducing private methods with good names would help. However, that doesn&#8217;t eliminate any of&nbsp;the possible code paths from the public methods. So, if you are lucky, you will see really long unit tests with complex setup conditions and mock expectations. Otherwise, there will be no tests at all! Without any tests for such long and complex methods, use them at your own risk. I won&#8217;t :(<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">Disclaimer: I like the play! framework a lot.

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Modules in Ruby are like classes with a few important differences. One of the differences is, a module cannot inherit from another module using the same syntax as class inheritance. However, its pretty easy to inherit a module&#8217;s method into another module, by just using the include ModuleToInclude syntax.
