We relocated to the northwest section of Calgary, Alberta on the 26th August. I am new to this part of the world and traveling to this opposite time zone (GMT+6 to GMT-6) took around 33 hours. Did you ever take a flight on Qatar? Not? I recommend it. They offer best foods for your south asian delight. My route was Dhaka - Doha - London - Calgary. I enjoyed the trip (don&#8217;t tell anyone, I was a bit scared when traveling over the Atlantic :-))<div><br /></div><div>The city of Calgary is really eye soothing green during this season. The little homes and lawns look fabulous in my eyes. People here celebrate the summer in style, you will see large family camping vans every now and then. So far the people here are also very friendly and welcoming towards new comers. It has been a good experience and hopefully coming days will be even better!</div><div><br /></div><div>On the 4th, I attended the graduate orientation program and met a lot of people. It was nice to know that the University of Calgary is equipped with all amenities required for an excellent graduate education. I am looking forward to use my free pass to the swimming pool! It&#8217;ll be fun!</div><div><br /></div><div>I met my supervisor, Frank, and also people at my Lab. My next duty will be to select a topic for my research by the end of this year. But the earlier it is selected, the better it is. Let me know if you have a good idea on your heads around agile software process/tools or digital tabletops.</div><div><br /></div><div>My upcoming posts will be a mix of my graduate studies and my software related works. Also, I will be TAing and wish to share some of my teaching experience as well. Stay tuned!</div></div>

Today is going to be my last day with the Code71 team and this is the last post of <a href="http://smsohan.blogspot.com/search/label/Code71">the series</a> on my Code71 days.<div><br /></div><div>The journey started on June 1, 2006 and now at this moment, I just wanted to summarize my takehome from the last three years&#8217; of work. I will go short, just touching the bits&#8230;</div><div><b>Teaming </b>is at the core of Code71&#8217;s culture. It went beyond teaming just for software development as we met outside for a movie, celebrated even the smallest of personal achievements and shared the excitement of a cricket or tennis match even at midnight from home over phone!</div><div><b>Planning and adapting </b>practice. I have gone through aprroximately 70 sprint planning and 50 sprint retrospect sessions at work. But this scrum habit of inspect and adapt has been engrossed in my personal life as well. I try to maintain a written to-do list with deadlines and look back at times.</div><div><b>Continuous learning. </b>As I worked on different technologies (<b>.Net/RoR</b>) and different domains (<b>Financial/Vehicle dealership/Project management/Web community</b>), I learned to grab new concepts. I developed a learning attitude towards solving a problem and realizing an opportunity.</div><div><b>Happy memories </b>are great as takehome gifts and I feel blessed to have a large array of such memories. Helping the team growing and maturing towards best-practices is itself a happy feeling. And there are those great memories with seeing a start-up client making millions, getting gift card from happy clients on new year&#8230; and of course the team meets at the Code71 dining.</div><div>I will end with <b>a few thanks note </b>here. Thanks to <a href="http://code71.com/AboutCode71/OurTeam/tabid/57/Default.aspx">Nimat</a> and <a href="http://blog.syedrayhan.com/">Syed </a>for believing in my competence and giving me the opportunity to work, lead and learn. (I am really sorry that the I had to turn down the L-1 offer, it really was too late!). Thanks to all of my teammates for your ever smiling faces and support. Thanks to <a href="http://syedraihan.com/">Omar</a>, my first mentor at Code71, for introducing me to the basics and the pathway to continuous learning. A special thanks to Sohel, our office assistant, for his ever enthusiastic service and care. Wishing best of luck to Shaer and his team, you will take the company to the next height inshaAllah.</div><div><br /></div><div>I am going to graduate school at <a href="http://ucalgary.ca/">University of Calgary</a>, Canada this fall to start my MS under <a href="http://ebe.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/Frank.Maurer/">Prof. Frank Maurer</a> and looking forward to it. I hope my experience at Code71 will help me in my future life and who knows, may be someday I will again be a part of the Code71 team!</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

<p>In my <a href="http://smsohan.blogspot.com/2009/08/rambling-stories-from-my-days-code71.html" target="_blank">previous post</a>, I got a bit nostalgic!

<p>Sighs!</p>  <p>Back then, on Friday, May 26, 2006, I was a final year undergrad student at <a href="http://www.buet.ac.bd/cse">CSE, BUET</a>. I was looking for a part-time software dev job opportunity and found a little one page advert for a student job at asha-technologies (lately renamed as <a href="http://code71.com/" target="_blank">Code71</a>). Visited their website and thought it might be worth giving a try!</p>  <p>As usual, I was interviewed over phone and enjoyed a long 2 hour interview on premise. I found it really inspiring and gained more interest towards the job after this session. I started waiting for a response… but was pretty certain about a positive one!</p>  <p>Good things happen in quick successions in our lives. Agree?</p>  <p>I agree. Because I just started a soul-journey with my soul-mate, Shahana, on the March of 2006. Then got the job offer on the 26th of May! Couldn’t be happier. A job for me during that time was just beyond its compensation, it was an inspiration, opportunity to see the real world and being part of something bigger than myself.</p>  <p><img height="214" src="http://photos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v3755/201/25/559702037/n559702037_2367230_3471408.jpg" width="222" /></p>  <p><em>Photo taken at Chhera dip (The Torn Island), St. Martins, Bangladesh. The last photograph taken with my first digital camera bought from my first month’s Salary!</em></p>  <p>I started my job on the 1st of June, 2006 at Asha-technologies. Asha-tech was still to find an office and <a href="http://syedraihan.com/" target="_blank">Omar</a> asked to meet him at his home office! That’s how it all started. We met a few times a week at Omar’s home until we moved to our office at the green building of green square at green road, Dhaka on the first of July.</p>  <p>Asha-tech signed up a client before it was even formed! So, once we moved into the office, we were building our first asha-tech product, an online loan financing gateway. We were enthusiastic about agile scrum/xp practices from the first day at office. The result was found in just less than 3 months. We rolled out our first release of the product. It was really a happy start. A fantastic start for a start-up. The client started generating revenue in less than 3 months of project inception!</p>  <p>The office setup was a small but adequate enough for our team. We installed long backup UPS (2 hours * 5 computers), A/C, IPS and dedicated internet connection with Wi-Fi. The work environment was full of fun. We were going for an outing to a team event every month and even more often going to delicious buffet places. We played table football and bowling… every time had a record breaking score and a new winner. We went swimming and believe me, <a href="http://syedraihan.com/" target="_blank">Omar</a> is as good a swimmer as he is a master in software technology. He would go to swimming with a flipper and flip like professional swimmers. He can even swim without using his hands/legs at all, lying side-on and in all such actions… I learned swimming keeping heads down and the easy way of breathing from him! Thanks!</p>  <p>Technologically we were maturing as well. Started using XPlanner for managing our project, attended daily standup meetings and started doing TDD. I won’t claim we got everything right at the first try… but, we were trying consistently, improving bit by bit… to this day.</p>  <p>For the most part, I was enjoying my job and became used to the pressure of a job + undergraduate studies. I said, good things happen in close succession. Another proof here! My first term final result with this job was a 4.0/4.0. I never scored 4.0 in a term before this nor had a 20+ hour/week job alongside my studies. </p>  <p>I strongly believe, my job taught me the attitude towards work, “plan, act and retrospect”. After over three years, I would suggest any new entrant in the software industry to start a career with passion. Its fun with passion. Its a win everyday with passion.</p></div>

<p>Naming conventions play an important role to the software&#8217;s overall architecture. It is not a rocket science, still, it may lead to unhappy consequences if not taken care of at the early stage of a project. This small best practices can make a code base significantly improved.</p> <p>Rails does a good job by using the dynamic power of ruby and providing with a handful of dynamic methods with the models. ActiveRecord::Base and its included modules follow a consistent naming, which clearly represent the intended purpose of the methods. At <a href="http://www.code71.com/" target="_blank">Code71</a>, we are working on <a href="http://www.scrumpad.com/" target="_blank">ScrumPad</a>, a 2nd generation agile scrum tool using ruby on rails and our model methods are named according to the following rules-</p> <p>1. All boolean returning methods end with &#8216;?&#8217;</p><pre class="brush: rails">company.billable?, sprint.current?, story.in_progress?</pre><p>2. Boolean methods do not start with is_ or has_ or did_ (as you might see in other popular languages)</p><pre class="brush: rails">company.is_billable? -&gt; company.billable?<br />sprint.is_current? -&gt; sprint.current?</pre><p>3. find_ and find_all are used only for class (self.find or self.find_all) methods and should return a single/array of object of the class respectively.</p><p>find_* methods may return a single object of the class/nil</p><p>find_all_* methods return an array of objects of the class or [], but never a nil</p><p>4. No methods start with a get_ as other languages.</p><p>5. A method ends with ! if it alters the object itself.</p><pre class="brush: rails">sprint.close!()<br />story.progress!()</pre><p>6. Methods that persists an object/may throw exception, should always end with ! (implied from rule 5)</p><pre class="brush: rails">invoice.update_status!(:paid)</pre><p>7. Always use parentheses &#8216;()&#8217; in method names. Future versions of ruby is deprecating the support for method names without parentheses.</p><p>Following these 7 simple rules we have consistent and intuitive model method names across the whole <a href="http://www.scrumpad.com/" target="_blank">ScrumPad</a>. Let me know if you have any suggestion to these names to make it even better.</p></div>

Thanks for these great tips. Sometimes only following the naming convention can save us a lot of time and effort to understand codes written by others. Keep posting such tips and tricks of beautiful coding.</div>

You are in the business if and only if you got a good physical structure and can stick to it for years&#8230;</p> <p>At <a href="http://www.code71.com/" target="_blank">Code71</a>, we are keeping our rails models attractive following a few guidelines. I will be posting these guidelines in a series and here goes the first one - about the physical structure of the ruby on rails models.</p> <p>We keep the following order consistent in our models:- </p><ol> <li>CONSTANTS</li> <li>has_one, has_many, belongs_to, has_and_belongs_to relations in dependency order</li> <li>plug-ins initialization (acts_as_tree, acts_as_state_machine etc.)</li> <li>validates_presence_of</li> <li>validates_uniqueness_of </li> <li>validates_numericality_of</li> <li>validates_format_of</li> <li>custom_validations</li> <li>named_scopes grouped by related purposes</li> <li>active record hooks (after_initialize, before_create, after_create, &#8230;) in execution order in the format (after_initialize [:assign_default_state, :sanitize_content] )</li> <li><strong>protected</strong></li> <li>hook method implementations according to execution order</li> <li><strong>public</strong></li> <li>constructor</li> <li>class methods in alphabetic order</li> <li>other methods alphabetically or grouped if related</li> <li><strong>protected</strong></li> <li>methods alphabetically or grouped if related</li> <li><strong>private</strong></li> <li>self methods in alphabetic order or similar methods in a group<br />other methods in alphabetic order or similar methods in a group<br /></li></ol> <p><strong><span style="color:#004000;">Rule</span></strong></p> <p>No method gets code real estate over 20 lines. If needed, one/more private methods are used.</p> <p><strong><span style="color:#004000;">How is this helping us?</span></strong></p> <ol> <li>We are absolutely sure where to look for a method or where to write a new method.</li> <li>The code base is really consistent.</li> <li>The unit test methods also follow the same order, which makes managing the test suite easy.</li></ol> <p>More to come later this week. Stay tuned!</p></div>

However, generating the breadcrumbs and showing them on dynamic pages sometimes need special care for the following reasons-</p>  <ol>   <li>The links of the breadcrumb may contain dynamic links. </li>    <li>It is used in all the pages. So, changing the breadcrumb may trigger a series of changes. </li> </ol>  <p>In <a href="http://scrumpad.com/" target="_blank">ScrumPad</a>, we are using ruby on rails. There are a few plugins to help rails projects in managing breadcrumbs, but none seemed to satisfy our need. In fact, most projects come up with some distinctive ways to generate the breadcrumbs. However, we kept the breadcrumb clean in the following way in <a href="http://scrumpad.com/" target="_blank">ScrumPad</a>.</p>  <p>Step#1:</p>  <p>Encapsulated the breadcrumb generation logic into a single class and used it from all places.</p>  <pre class="brush: rails">class Breadcrumb<br />include ActionView::Helpers::UrlHelper<br />include ActionView::Helpers::TagHelper<br />include ApplicationHelper<br /><br />attr_accessor :parts, :separator, :prefix<br /><br />def initialize(separator = nil, parts = [])<br />  self.separator = separator || "&lt;img src="\"/images/stub_arrow_right.gif\"" /&gt;"<br />  self.parts = parts<br />end<br /><br />def add(title, url = nil)<br />  self.parts &lt;&lt; {:title =&gt; title, :url =&gt; url}<br />end<br /><br />def set_prefix(title, url)<br />  self.prefix = {:title =&gt; title, :url =&gt; url}<br />end<br /><br />def to_s<br />  if(!self.parts.nil? and !self.parts.empty?)<br />    if(self.prefix.nil?)<br />      parts_with_prefix = self.parts<br />    else<br />      parts_with_prefix = [self.prefix] + self.parts<br />    end<br />  <br />    breadcrumb_html = []<br />    parts_with_prefix.each do |part|<br />      if(part[:url].nil? or part[:url].empty?)<br />        breadcrumb_html &lt;&lt; "<span>#{part[:title]}</span>"<br />      else<br />        breadcrumb_html &lt;&lt; link_to(part[:title], part[:url])<br />      end<br />    end<br />    return breadcrumb_html.join(" #{self.separator} ")<br />  end<br />  return ''<br />end<br />end</pre><p>Step#2:</p><p>A before_filter in the ActionController initializes the breadcrumb in the following way:-</p><pre class="brush: rails">def initialize_breadcrumb()<br />  @breadcrumb = Breadcrumb.new<br />  if(project_selected?)<br />    @breadcrumb.prefix = {:title =&gt; "Dashboard", :url =&gt; dashboard_project_path(selected_project())}<br />  end<br />end</pre><p>Step#3:</p><p>Now, @breadcrumb is available to all actions. However, if the RESTful resource definition is right, the rest of the breadcrumb generation becomes really simple. We have methods like the following in our controllers-</p><pre class="brush: rails">def generate_breadcrumb(sprint, story = nil)<br />  @breadcrumb.add(sprint.name, project_sprint_path(project.id, sprint.id))<br />  if(!story.nil?)<br />    @breadcrumb.add(story.display_title, story_path(story))<br />  elsif(self.action_name != 'index')<br />    @breadcrumb.add('Stories', stories_path())<br />  end<br /><br />  current_page = self.action_name == 'index' ? 'Stories' : self.action_name.humanize<br />  @breadcrumb.add(current_page)<br />end</pre><p>Step#4:</p><p>Finally, in my view layout, I just use this instance variable as shown here:-</p><pre class="brush: rails">&lt;%= @breadcrumb %&gt;</pre><p>So, the whole breadcrumb generation is encapsulated and the implementation is clean. Let me know if you liked it. I am in the process of creating a plugin so that anyone can just drop it in any rails app and start using straight away!</p></div>

This was really a cool way to implement breadcrumb in Rails. Looking forward for the plugin&#8230; as it really seems lifesaver for developers :)</div>

<p>In my <a href="http://smsohan.blogspot.com/2009/06/lesson1-going-incremental-is-natural.html" target="_blank">previous post</a>, I said about being incremental. Here come the next thing, being “ITERATIVE”. A prefer the term Sprint than Iteration.</p>  <p>So, once you decided to take small increments, make sure you reach the targets sprinting.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_Gr1ozXzBWpM/SjX_DmKLDgI/AAAAAAAAAFo/xYRbI8rsbVI/s1600-h/sprint%5B3%5D.jpg"><img title="sprint" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="260" alt="sprint" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_Gr1ozXzBWpM/SjX_EyH2GEI/AAAAAAAAAFs/c7e42WMAbEI/sprint_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="347" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>I suggest you prepare for sprinting with the right techniques and tools. A few recommendations-</p>  <ol>   <li>Never miss a daily standup meeting. Spend only 2 minutes (or less) per person answering the three questions – what did you do yesterday, what’s on the plate for today and what is blocking the race?</li>    <li>Install visual clues for bringing the under the hood stuffs to daylight. Remember, being able to address the loopholes is the key. The solution usually follows automatically.</li> </ol>  <p>The key concept to internalize is, sprinting is a balance race. You need a good start and keep the momentum to reach the touch line on time. Its a small race and if you fall back, the touch line may seem too far to celebrate.</p>  <p>At Code71, <a href="http://scrumpad.com" target="_blank">ScrumPad</a>, is helping us in sprinting. Our sprints are two week sprints in most projects. We found the team communication holds a key in meeting the deadline. Since, within a sprint, someone of the team may need an unplanned vacation or an issue may arise out of the blue, the team needs to step up and put extra efforts. Again, visual clues help the team in keeping everybody posted timely.</p>  <p>If a team finds it difficult to meet the deadline and find the sprint length to be too small, then what? Should they linger the sprint length? NO. The solution is to even shorten the length. To make sure, the team can plan for short spans with better accuracy. Lingering the sprint length addresses the wrong disease and hence may not solve the problem.</p>  </div>

I think 2 week sprint is a good sprint length and appropriate for most of the project.</div>

I think for big projects and a big teams sprint lengths also should have to be big enough for a maximum outcome.</div>

<p>As Scrum and Agile processes tell you, do it in small sprints, 2 weeks preferably, and go incremental. Take a small piece at a time and sprint. </p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_Gr1ozXzBWpM/SidMvX7yttI/AAAAAAAAAFc/HvBvxUoFJdY/s1600-h/human-evolution-t10176%5B3%5D.jpg"><img title="human-evolution-t10176" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="293" alt="human-evolution-t10176" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_Gr1ozXzBWpM/SidMx5T5PoI/AAAAAAAAAFg/0U5KZOhlt7c/human-evolution-t10176_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="407" border="0" /></a> </p>  <blockquote>   <p><em>I took this image from internet and credits to </em><a href="http://blogs.houstonpress.com/" target="_blank"><em>this site.</em></a></p> </blockquote>  <p>It’s easy to work out the Natural way than to defy it! If you are iterative and incremental, you are reaching towards the right hand side of the image! And to make the evolution faster, I suggest you try out Scrumming with <a href="http://scrumpad.com/" target="_blank">ScrumPad</a>. If you value “teaming” and “delivering” in sprints, <a href="http://scrumpad.com/" target="_blank">ScrumPad</a> will give you the oxygen to breathe while you sprint!</p>  <p>I suggest you follow a routine to iterate. At <a href="http://code71.com/" target="_blank">Code71</a>, we follow the below-</p>  <p><strong>Day 1:</strong> Plan for the next 9 days. Breakdown work items into smaller tasks, estimate at hours for each of the tasks and assign each task to an individual.</p>  <p><strong>Day 8: </strong>Release in test server (shadow version of the real production environment) and collect customer feedback.</p>  <p><strong>Day 9: </strong>Work on customer feedback and go live in production server. Always tag the version that is put in the production following the standard -</p>  <blockquote>   <p>R&lt;ProductReleaseVersion&gt;.S&lt;SprintNumber&gt;.B&lt;BuildNumber&gt;.P&lt;PatchNumber&gt;</p> </blockquote>  <p>This gives us the rollback point when there is any issue in the latest production deploy. Of course, we make sure we do not need to touch on the tags too often!</p>  <p>How are you sprinting? Let me know if you have a suggestion.</p></div>

Very helpful post for the beginner who want to learn about Scrum. In Code71 we are using ScrumPad from it&#39;s 2nd sprint. It helps us to speed up our project work as well as follow the Scrum. Also collaboration part is very helpful to communicate with clients specially for the team who work remotely.</div>

Good post.I think incremental development process plays a pivotal role over waterfall in software industry(for most of our regular projects) nowadays.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p>I was talking to a friend of mine, who started a IT start up and working full time with a few others to foster the business. He was telling me-</p>  <blockquote>   <p style="background-color: #fff200"><em>“We have 13 projects running at this moment. We are working our heart out. But, we are not finding any time to do Test Driven Development, Continuous Integration and all the good things…”</em></p> </blockquote>  <p>Well, I understand how it feels! As the title says, “Its easier to get lost!”</p>  <p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_Gr1ozXzBWpM/SiZB7nxv4hI/AAAAAAAAAFU/5Ye5BRK3vsE/s1600-h/maze%5B3%5D.jpg"><img title="maze" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="338" alt="maze" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_Gr1ozXzBWpM/SiZB9jKM9iI/AAAAAAAAAFY/IUmlB7qh55o/maze_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="338" border="0" /></a>&#160;</p>  <p><em>Do you fancy getting stuck at this maze?</em></p>  <p>For startups, it is difficult to control the pulse. Because, you want to reach your billion dollar spot as early as possible, this week, or even earlier, today or even just in a few hours! And, as days go by, you start to feel the need for some process, to safeguard your efforts and quality, to hit the deadlines, to get in the rhythm of a sustainable pace.</p>  <p>But it may be really difficult to catch the ball at the first jump. We, at <a href="http://Code71.com" target="_blank">Code71</a>, believe we need to be visibly competent and confident about the quality of our work. And worked hard to get the gears together in motion. Now it is cliques great. We have got the people motivated to follow the best practices, the tools to “do more with less” and the process to ensure a “sustainable pace”. I advise, you do at least the following to learn to escape the maze from tomorrow-</p>  <ul>   <ul>     <li><strong>DIE</strong> for planning. Plan for short spans. We plan for two week sprints. </li>      <li>While planning, estimate honestly. Estimate all the hours necessary for following best practices. (producing automated test scripts may take 40% longer time, but bear with it) </li>      <li>Plan on your inputs. You cannot push your inputs. So, you may need to squeeze the output to match against your capacity. </li>      <li><strong>DIE</strong> to meet the deadline according to the plan. </li>   </ul> </ul>  <p>This is the mindset. You need to start believing to sustain. You need to plan honestly and never miss a deadline. After reaching the deadline, you retrospect. Find the loopholes and start filling those one by one. If you don’t see a loophole, find a ladder to reach higher. But do not place a ladder on a land mine!</p>  <p>Its not difficult if you have the preparation. To prepare, at a minimum do the following-</p>  <ul>   <li>Have a Continuous Integration (CI) server up and running 24x7 or <strong>DIE</strong>. (We use <a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">CruiseControl</a>, its free and great) </li>    <li>Make your CI server to send build, test and coverage report for you. Keep an eye on the coverage report and <strong>DIE</strong> to remain well above the the 80% line. </li>    <li>Keep track of your activities for retrospect. We use <a href="http://scrumpad.com" target="_blank">ScrumPad</a>. It helps you to iterate, collaborate and deliver. </li> </ul>  <p>The keyword is <strong>“sustainable pace”</strong>. I found Scrum to address this sustainable pace really smartly. If you haven’t tried yet and looking for the loopholes to fill or the ladder to climb up, I suggest you learn about agile and <a href="http://www.goodagile.com/scrumprimer/index.html" target="_blank">Scrum</a>, find an expert and give it a try. It’s worth than you might have expected.</p>  <p>If you know a better way to keep delivering better, I will appreciate for sharing your idea to me. </p>  </div>
