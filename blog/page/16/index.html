  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Ever since I started working in the software industry, as a freelancer or representing a company, I found the most challenging part of a remote software development project is &#8220;Communication&#8221;. In agile setup, collaboration plays a leading role to be effective and efficient.<div><br /><div>By communication, I mean the following:-<div><ol><li>Getting the spec as intended by the client.</li><li>Asking specific questions on time.</li><li>Status update about progress, blocks and forthcoming events.</li><li>Getting feedback as intended by the client.</li><li>Making specific suggestions with rationale to the client.</li></ol><div>I am listing a few tools that I used and recommend others to use.</div><div><ol><li><b>A note pad:</b> I write down small bullet points as soon as I find a question/suggestion/idea.</li><li><b>Voice chat/telephone call:</b> It should be #1 preference. Its real time and most speedy after face-to-face. I use Skype for my voice calls and sometimes my phone as well.</li><li><b>IM</b>: I use GoogleTalk most of the time if it works with client. Otherwise, I just use the one that my client uses most frequently.</li><li><b>Collaboration tool: </b>I use <a href="http://scrumpad.com/">ScrumPad.com</a>. Post my messages, people get email notification and can directly reply on that notification. This way the collaboration is all captured in ScrumPad and we can also keep using Email.</li><li><b>A wire framing/drawing tool: </b>Sometimes a small sketch/piece of drawing may greatly ease the communication hurdle. I use MS Visio at times. However, I also use scanned copies of hand drawings and annotations. It works. However, I am looking for a good web based wire framing tool and I believe it will off-load a lot of decision confusions.</li><li><b>Desktop sharing tool: </b>Screen capture and desktop sharing also works for me. I use LogMeIn and Xing. These tools offer first class feedback capturing capability from remote clients.</li></ol><div>I also try to follow some general rules:</div><div><ol><li>Always have a prioritized list of points that I want to discuss.</li><li>Be on time.</li><li>Never stay disconnected for more than 3 business days.</li></ol><div>I am sure out-sourcing will keep growing in the coming days, not only for its low cost but also for the fact that they are getting smarter and equally competent as people who charge many folds compared to them. I also anticipate a lot of out-sourcing job will go to individuals or 2/3 person groups, may be not from fortune 500 companies, but there are still other unfortunate millions of companies who will need such small teams. If you plan to work remotely, I am sure you will need some of the above tools, and if you are already in the business and think you have other good tools, please share with me.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

If you are like me, with little creativity with UI (!), on a new project you always start with a simple layout, banner followed by a row of menu and then a two column body that ends with a footer. Well, here is an example:-<div>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</div><div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="white-space: normal; color: rgb(0, 153, 0); ">CampZero<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">     </span></span></span></div><div><i><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#006600;">zero hassle camping</span></i></div><div>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#3366FF;">Home </span>| <span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#3366FF;">Place a booking</span></div><div>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#003333;">Welcome</span></span><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">      <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">    <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span> <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">   <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">       </span></span></span></span>|</div><div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre; ">        <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">      <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">      <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">        </span></span></span></span>|</div><div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre; ">        <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">      <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">      <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">        </span></span></span></span>|</div><div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre; ">        <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">      <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">      <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">        </span></span></span></span>|</div><div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre; ">        <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">      <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">      <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">        </span></span></span></span>|</div><div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre; ">        <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">      <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">      <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">        </span></span></span></span>|<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span></div><div>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</div><div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:x-small;">    </span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:x-small;">Campzero.com, all rights reserved</span></div><div>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</div><div>Well, there are other ways and you will almost always see good visual elements in most websites. However, somehow all of these beautiful sites come with some sort of menu. This post is about a site that doesn&#8217;t have a menu at all.</div><div><b>Yes it is possible to create a web app without a menu. </b>The application that I recently developed is designed around an intuitive workflow. The workflow itself drives the app and it does so without any menu. For example, on landing you see a dashboard with three sections. Main section shows highlights of different projects, sidebar contains the search box and top part contains profile card. Now, you can navigate the whole application from here. For example, select a project you will see main section with the project latest activities and the search box will search in the scope of the project.</div><div>The point is, if you know the users of your app will most likely follow one of a few workflows, then you can design a UI that flows naturally.</div><div><br /></div></div>

Excellent post.. In my opinion a most intuitive UI is the key for attracting the users most. I wish to have some knowledge about UI engineering shortly.</div>

I worked on the following story:-<blockquote><div></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;As a</span> partner, <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">when</span> I visit a project&#8217;s dashboard I <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">want</span> to see five most recently started or updated discussion threads with number of unread comments, if any. If any of these are new, I want to see them in a highlighted view. Next, if I open the thread, I want to see all new comments in a highlighted view as well. However, once seen, the threads/comments should no longer be highlighted from the rest.&#8221;</div></blockquote><div></div><div>I used the following steps to implement this.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Step#1: Added a model MessageReadTime (message_id, user_id, last_read_at)</span></div><div><pre class="brush: rails">class Message <br />has_many :messages_read_times <br />end</pre></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Step#2: Added filters in the messages_controller</span></div><div><pre class="brush: rails">after_filter :update_message_read_time, :only => [:show]<br />def update_message_read_time<br />read_time = MessageReadTime.find_or_create_by_message_id_and_user_id( params[:id], current_user.id)<br />read_time.last_read_at = Time.now<br />read_time.save!<br />end</pre></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Step#3: Added :touch=>true and unread? function in Comment class</span></div><div><pre class="brush: rails">class Comment<br />..<br />belongs_to :message, :touch => true<br />def unread?(user)<br /> read_time = self.message.message_read_times.find_by_user_id(user_id)<br /> return true unless(read_time)<br /> return read_time.last_read_at < (updated_at || created_at)       end   end</pre></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Step#4: Added unread_comments method in Message class like this</span></div><div><pre class="brush:rails">class Message<br />...<br />def unread_comments(user)<br />self.comments.collect{|comment| comment.unread?(user) ? comment : nil }.compact<br />end<br /><br />def unread?(user)<br />read_time = self.message_read_times.find_by_user_id(user.id)<br />return true unless read_time<br />return self.updated_at >= read_time.last_read_at<br />end<br />...<br />end</pre></div><div>This is it!

Previously I used a few plugins in RoR projects including <a href="http://scrumpad.com/">ScrumPad</a>.

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; ">This intro is from the presenters:-<br /><blockquote>PAS was a joint venture development initiative by 4 major oil and gas<br />companies and CGI. Devon, Encana, Husky and Talisman joined with CGI to<br />develop a new Production and Revenue Application. Each company put 3 senior<br />business resources on the project. The development component of the PAS<br />initiative cost $35M over 5 years with up to 90 people on the team. This<br />presentation is on how we used Agile to achieve this mammoth undertaking.<br /><br />The product is currently running in production at 5 major oil and gas<br />companies with great reviews. It is also in production for several mid and<br />smaller sized companies. CGI is currently marketing the product.</blockquote>This was my first ever meet with the <a href="http://www.calgaryagile.com/">Calgary agile methods user group, CAMUG</a> and it was a great experience. Off late, I have been looking for my graduate research topic on agile methods, especially around scaling agile beyond a single team and this was just a perfect session for me.</span><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">I noted down a few of their discussed topics that I would like to share with my readers:</span></div><div><ol><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; ">The project continued in dev mode for 5 years, a $35M project.</span><br /></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; ">It started with only 3 members and extended to a team of 90 following Scrum+XP.</span><br /></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">The project had 5 sponsoring companies or clients.</span></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">They had 6 teams working in the same sprint cycles.</span></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">In each team, there were significant members from the business working full time with the team onsite and in the same open-space arrangement.</span></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">They had some 3000+ unit tests and also 300+ acceptance test.</span></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">They automated all repetitive tests.</span></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">The had external experts visiting them from time to time.

They said, it would be challenging.</span> But in response, they also said, following waterfall would make life much harder with such a big team, if at all it could be a success at the first place! Yes, I also believe this.</li><li>One of the audiences asked if they outsourced a part of the project and the response was &#8216;No&#8217;. CGI has a big team in India with a very high CMM ranking, but the project manager and asst. project manager said, it would be much difficult for differing time zones. Also, it would be difficult to transfer the knowledge as well as replicate the value of onsite client presence. The development manager also added that, the cultural difference between an agile and CMM setup would also been an issue if they had to go for the off-shore team.</li></ol><div>The session was much more eventful than what I could compile.

We relocated to the northwest section of Calgary, Alberta on the 26th August. I am new to this part of the world and traveling to this opposite time zone (GMT+6 to GMT-6) took around 33 hours. Did you ever take a flight on Qatar? Not? I recommend it. They offer best foods for your south asian delight. My route was Dhaka - Doha - London - Calgary. I enjoyed the trip (don&#8217;t tell anyone, I was a bit scared when traveling over the Atlantic :-))<div><br /></div><div>The city of Calgary is really eye soothing green during this season. The little homes and lawns look fabulous in my eyes. People here celebrate the summer in style, you will see large family camping vans every now and then. So far the people here are also very friendly and welcoming towards new comers. It has been a good experience and hopefully coming days will be even better!</div><div><br /></div><div>On the 4th, I attended the graduate orientation program and met a lot of people. It was nice to know that the University of Calgary is equipped with all amenities required for an excellent graduate education. I am looking forward to use my free pass to the swimming pool! It&#8217;ll be fun!</div><div><br /></div><div>I met my supervisor, Frank, and also people at my Lab. My next duty will be to select a topic for my research by the end of this year. But the earlier it is selected, the better it is. Let me know if you have a good idea on your heads around agile software process/tools or digital tabletops.</div><div><br /></div><div>My upcoming posts will be a mix of my graduate studies and my software related works. Also, I will be TAing and wish to share some of my teaching experience as well. Stay tuned!</div></div>

Today is going to be my last day with the Code71 team and this is the last post of <a href="http://smsohan.blogspot.com/search/label/Code71">the series</a> on my Code71 days.<div><br /></div><div>The journey started on June 1, 2006 and now at this moment, I just wanted to summarize my takehome from the last three years&#8217; of work. I will go short, just touching the bits&#8230;</div><div><b>Teaming </b>is at the core of Code71&#8217;s culture. It went beyond teaming just for software development as we met outside for a movie, celebrated even the smallest of personal achievements and shared the excitement of a cricket or tennis match even at midnight from home over phone!</div><div><b>Planning and adapting </b>practice. I have gone through aprroximately 70 sprint planning and 50 sprint retrospect sessions at work. But this scrum habit of inspect and adapt has been engrossed in my personal life as well. I try to maintain a written to-do list with deadlines and look back at times.</div><div><b>Continuous learning. </b>As I worked on different technologies (<b>.Net/RoR</b>) and different domains (<b>Financial/Vehicle dealership/Project management/Web community</b>), I learned to grab new concepts. I developed a learning attitude towards solving a problem and realizing an opportunity.</div><div><b>Happy memories </b>are great as takehome gifts and I feel blessed to have a large array of such memories. Helping the team growing and maturing towards best-practices is itself a happy feeling. And there are those great memories with seeing a start-up client making millions, getting gift card from happy clients on new year&#8230; and of course the team meets at the Code71 dining.</div><div>I will end with <b>a few thanks note </b>here. Thanks to <a href="http://code71.com/AboutCode71/OurTeam/tabid/57/Default.aspx">Nimat</a> and <a href="http://blog.syedrayhan.com/">Syed </a>for believing in my competence and giving me the opportunity to work, lead and learn. (I am really sorry that the I had to turn down the L-1 offer, it really was too late!). Thanks to all of my teammates for your ever smiling faces and support. Thanks to <a href="http://syedraihan.com/">Omar</a>, my first mentor at Code71, for introducing me to the basics and the pathway to continuous learning. A special thanks to Sohel, our office assistant, for his ever enthusiastic service and care. Wishing best of luck to Shaer and his team, you will take the company to the next height inshaAllah.</div><div><br /></div><div>I am going to graduate school at <a href="http://ucalgary.ca/">University of Calgary</a>, Canada this fall to start my MS under <a href="http://ebe.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/Frank.Maurer/">Prof. Frank Maurer</a> and looking forward to it. I hope my experience at Code71 will help me in my future life and who knows, may be someday I will again be a part of the Code71 team!</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

<p>In my <a href="http://smsohan.blogspot.com/2009/08/rambling-stories-from-my-days-code71.html" target="_blank">previous post</a>, I got a bit nostalgic! However, ever since I posted the first one, I was looking for another post on the series.

<p>Sighs!</p>  <p>Back then, on Friday, May 26, 2006, I was a final year undergrad student at <a href="http://www.buet.ac.bd/cse">CSE, BUET</a>. I was looking for a part-time software dev job opportunity and found a little one page advert for a student job at asha-technologies (lately renamed as <a href="http://code71.com/" target="_blank">Code71</a>). Visited their website and thought it might be worth giving a try!</p>  <p>As usual, I was interviewed over phone and enjoyed a long 2 hour interview on premise. I found it really inspiring and gained more interest towards the job after this session. I started waiting for a response… but was pretty certain about a positive one!</p>  <p>Good things happen in quick successions in our lives. Agree?</p>  <p>I agree. Because I just started a soul-journey with my soul-mate, Shahana, on the March of 2006. Then got the job offer on the 26th of May! Couldn’t be happier. A job for me during that time was just beyond its compensation, it was an inspiration, opportunity to see the real world and being part of something bigger than myself.</p>  <p><img height="214" src="http://photos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v3755/201/25/559702037/n559702037_2367230_3471408.jpg" width="222" /></p>  <p><em>Photo taken at Chhera dip (The Torn Island), St. Martins, Bangladesh. The last photograph taken with my first digital camera bought from my first month’s Salary!</em></p>  <p>I started my job on the 1st of June, 2006 at Asha-technologies. Asha-tech was still to find an office and <a href="http://syedraihan.com/" target="_blank">Omar</a> asked to meet him at his home office! That’s how it all started. We met a few times a week at Omar’s home until we moved to our office at the green building of green square at green road, Dhaka on the first of July.</p>  <p>Asha-tech signed up a client before it was even formed! So, once we moved into the office, we were building our first asha-tech product, an online loan financing gateway. We were enthusiastic about agile scrum/xp practices from the first day at office. The result was found in just less than 3 months. We rolled out our first release of the product. It was really a happy start. A fantastic start for a start-up. The client started generating revenue in less than 3 months of project inception!</p>  <p>The office setup was a small but adequate enough for our team. We installed long backup UPS (2 hours * 5 computers), A/C, IPS and dedicated internet connection with Wi-Fi. The work environment was full of fun. We were going for an outing to a team event every month and even more often going to delicious buffet places. We played table football and bowling… every time had a record breaking score and a new winner. We went swimming and believe me, <a href="http://syedraihan.com/" target="_blank">Omar</a> is as good a swimmer as he is a master in software technology. He would go to swimming with a flipper and flip like professional swimmers. He can even swim without using his hands/legs at all, lying side-on and in all such actions… I learned swimming keeping heads down and the easy way of breathing from him! Thanks!</p>  <p>Technologically we were maturing as well. Started using XPlanner for managing our project, attended daily standup meetings and started doing TDD. I won’t claim we got everything right at the first try… but, we were trying consistently, improving bit by bit… to this day.</p>  <p>For the most part, I was enjoying my job and became used to the pressure of a job + undergraduate studies. I said, good things happen in close succession. Another proof here! My first term final result with this job was a 4.0/4.0. I never scored 4.0 in a term before this nor had a 20+ hour/week job alongside my studies. </p>  <p>I strongly believe, my job taught me the attitude towards work, “plan, act and retrospect”. After over three years, I would suggest any new entrant in the software industry to start a career with passion. Its fun with passion. Its a win everyday with passion.</p></div>
