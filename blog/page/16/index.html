I am up to a web venture called www.CampZero.com - an online market place for you service providers in Bangladesh. This is somewhat similar in spirit to classified sites like ebay and craigslist, but the target market it consciously chosen to be the service industry. Anyway, I will go to the point why I picked rails for this project and how it is paying off.<div><br /></div><div>A little background about me. I have some good background on .Net/C# and I developed several projects using this technologies. Also, I have some experience with Rails and developed almost same number of projects as that of .Net. So, I made an informed decision about choosing the Ruby on Rails framework for my project over .Net/C#. Here&#8217;s the rationale:</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Story#1: As a CampZero developer, I want to deploy the system as soon as I am done with a feature.</b></div><div>Solution: Use capistrano to automate the deployment process. It took me less than 30 minutes to setup the automatic one-click deployment. The deployment steps are at a minimum as follows:</div><div><ol><li>Get the latest code from the code repository.</li><li>Create a link to the shared log directory.</li><li>Create a link to the shared assets directory.</li><li>Create a link to the full text search configuration file.</li><li>Migrate the database schema.</li><li>Change the link to the application to the latest code.</li><li>Restart the full text search engine.</li><li>Restart the web server.</li><li>Rollback if any step of 1-8 results in a failure.</li></ol><div>The whole process is triggered by a single line of command &#8221;<b>cap staging deploy:migrations</b>&#8221; and takes less that 3 minutes to complete on an average.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Story#2: As a guest user of CampZero, I would like to sign up for an account so that I can post an ad and/or rank the service providers.</b></div></div><div>The signup process is actually a three step process as follows:</div><div><ol><li>Create account, with password encrypted.</li><li>Get an email with an activation link.</li><li>Verify email address by clicking an activation link.</li></ol><div>Also, there are several related works as follows:</div><div><ol><li>Login</li><li>Logout</li><li>Reset password</li></ol><div>I used Authlogic for this purpose and it has taken care of all the aspects for me. For emailing I used ActionMailer. The whole job of authentication took no more than 4 hours! Thanks again to Authlogic.</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold; ">Story#3: As a user of CampZero, I want to search for service providers using natural text.</span></div><div>The full text search was implemented using Sphinx and Thinking-sphinx. This also comes with default support for paginating lists. So, Thinking sphinx took care of all my search needs. I used the following features:</div><div><ol><li>Search by full text in the service description, title.</li><li>Also search the service provider names and service categories.</li><li>Rank by the ratings.</li><li>Search using English morphology, for example, if searching for &#8216;cars&#8217; it also searches for &#8216;car&#8217;.</li></ol><div>I spent as little as 6 hours to setup and code the whole free text search! The total coding size for search is less than even 15 lines in total!</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Story#4: As a service consumer, I want to rate and write comment on my service providers so that other consumers can make informed decisions.</b></div><div>I used two plugins called, rate-fu and acts as commentable! These plugins are great time savers as well. All the underlying logics for handling ratings and commenting are already there and you merely plug the features in. It took me 5 hours and most of it was due to the UI part!</div><div><br /></div><div>I am convinced that for most web applications now, Ruby on Rails is an automatic best seller. But, of course, my prior experience helped me in getting things done even faster. Lets see how this project makes a business :-)</div></div><div><br /></div></div></div><div><br /></div><div> </div></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
In a single line, the first semester has been awesome.<div>Some of you already know that I came to Calgary, AB, Canada this fall to start a graduate research focusing agile software development. So, to get started I tried to come up with a research idea by hunting several resources including popular publications, blogs and books. This is not yet over&#8230;</div><div>However, I took a course called Applied Machine Learning and had the opportunity to work on a project that might lead to my MS thesis. The project, Auto Tagging Emails with User Stories, targets to grab and automatically tag emails with user stories based on a project&#8217;s context information. The trick is, if you see the text similarity between an email and a user story and complement with their temporal and meta data similarity, you can make a guess about their relation. I wanted to make it an automatic process so that when people share knowledge in emails they can easily make use of this knowledge for future references. The project was successful in its scope and I submitted a paper day before yesterday. Keeping my fingers crossed to see the decision on this paper!</div><div>Apart from the project, this course also offered the unique opportunity to work with Prof. Dr. Richter. He was really helpful and spent a lot of time on my project and the paper.</div><div><br /><object width="400" height="265"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=7942838&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1"><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=7942838&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="265"></embed></object><p><a href="http://vimeo.com/7942838">Tavolo: A Tabletop Application for Conferences</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user2731498">Chris Luce</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.</p><br /></div><div>I also did a group project for the Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces course. This project was called &#8220;Tavolo&#8221;, a surface solution for conferences where people could bring their research ideas through images/videos/pdfs and annotate/share with others. This was my first ever tabletop project. We used Microsoft Surface and I liked the hardware so far. But in the end I found that the size and low resolution of the surface limited our opportunity to implement several features of the project. But in a nutshell this project gave me the opportunity to try something around Human Computer Interaction and next generation collaboration designs.</div><div>During the last week of November, I attended the ITS2009 conference. It was a 3 day international conference people came from all continents. I liked the presentations and the fact that this research community is as if its a connected web. I must say, the Bill Buxton speech was a great one. He envisioned the next generation human computer interaction and also discussed about real life commercial applications coming out of the research. It was very inspiring!</div><div>I also submitted a grant application to iCore. I am personally convinced that this was a good proposal and I have the necessary background to make it a successful research. But according to my supervisor, its a good idea to be less optimistic with iCore fund. Anyway, composing this application helped me in finding some of the holes in my writing and thinking skills. I will happily take this lesson!</div><div>In my family life, this was an eventful time as well. My wife, Shahana, got admitted to the ECE department at University of Calgary and she will start her MS this January. This means we might be graduating at similar times and be back to Bangladesh soon thereafter. Wish we make good use of the opportunity in our graduate studies.</div><div>Well, this is a pretty much a summary! But I forgot one thing, Swimming! For the last month and half, I am going to swimming 3/4 days a week and enjoying this activity. The university swimming pool, like all other games and sports venues, is really well maintained.</div><div>I am looking for a Camera and waiting for the Boxing Day sale. Let me know if you saw a good DSLR camera around $500!</div><div>Oh! I forgot another announcement! I have taken my first web venture at<span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"> </span><a href="http://www.campzero.com/"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;">www.campzero.com</span></a>! If you have some time stop by and let me know if you like/dislike the idea and its presentation. I am planning to go live from Jan 1 2010! </div><div>Merry Christmas! </div><div>  </div></div>

@Syed Raihan, this is a RoR project. After I worked in .Net and RoR for over 3.5 years, I realize that at this moment RoR is the better choice for a web project for me.<br />Any comment on the business idea?</div>

So, what are these core principles? Well, most of you already know the phrase, &#8220;Inspect and Adapt&#8221;. Now, you also know a bunch of specifications that facilitate this, for an instance, Scrum, XP etc.</div><div><br /></div><div>Reading the book, I had a realization that, its good to talk using concrete facts as much as possible. So, doing a <b>value stream mapping</b> practice is worth than spending hours in discussing the process optimization. The same holds true with the <b>Profit and Loss </b>statement when figuring out which option to take - quality compromise, deadline shifting or feature squeezing. Being able to answer <b>why </b>questions, at least 5 in a succession, is something very critical - then you know the hidden junk thats causing the bad smell. I highly recommend reading this book, especially to people who are doing agile for a year or so and thinking about getting better at it.</div><div><br /></div><div>I also had the opportunity to attend a speech by the authors on this Monday. The speech was a great one. But for my readers, I will write about an example from the speech.</div><div><br /></div><div>Once Mary and Tom visited a company that creates hardware and software tools for real time video conferencing. They met the Boss there and asked what they were doing. The answer was, &#8220;We are working to improve the system so that our customers get better video conferencing solution for their businesses.&#8221; They went to a section where people were working on hardware and asked one what he was doing. The person replied, &#8220;I am creating a component for the system, so that our customers can do better video conferencing&#8221;. Then they went to a software developer and asked what she was doing. She replied, &#8220;I am working to improve a part of the software so that our customers can do better video conferencing&#8221;&#8230;. (I am sure Mary used better words than mine and it was really interesting to hear the story in her voice :-))</div><div><br /></div><div>So, the fact that she wanted to capture using this example is, although each individual is involved in a specific task, they envision the bigger picture from the customers&#8217; standpoint. This is really important. Because as soon as you start seeing the views from the customers&#8217; perspective, you will produce less bugs. In the book they mentioned, most software bugs are not results of coding/design errors, rather they arise from the difference in views among customers and developers.</div><div><br /></div><div>Overall, it was a pleasure to read the book, although this blog post may not reflect all of my respect and take home from the book :-(  </div><div><br /></div><div><br /><div><br /></div></div></div>

Ever since I started working in the software industry, as a freelancer or representing a company, I found the most challenging part of a remote software development project is &#8220;Communication&#8221;. In agile setup, collaboration plays a leading role to be effective and efficient.<div><br /><div>By communication, I mean the following:-<div><ol><li>Getting the spec as intended by the client.</li><li>Asking specific questions on time.</li><li>Status update about progress, blocks and forthcoming events.</li><li>Getting feedback as intended by the client.</li><li>Making specific suggestions with rationale to the client.</li></ol><div>I am listing a few tools that I used and recommend others to use.</div><div><ol><li><b>A note pad:</b> I write down small bullet points as soon as I find a question/suggestion/idea.</li><li><b>Voice chat/telephone call:</b> It should be #1 preference. Its real time and most speedy after face-to-face. I use Skype for my voice calls and sometimes my phone as well.</li><li><b>IM</b>: I use GoogleTalk most of the time if it works with client. Otherwise, I just use the one that my client uses most frequently.</li><li><b>Collaboration tool: </b>I use <a href="http://scrumpad.com/">ScrumPad.com</a>. Post my messages, people get email notification and can directly reply on that notification. This way the collaboration is all captured in ScrumPad and we can also keep using Email.</li><li><b>A wire framing/drawing tool: </b>Sometimes a small sketch/piece of drawing may greatly ease the communication hurdle. I use MS Visio at times. However, I also use scanned copies of hand drawings and annotations. It works. However, I am looking for a good web based wire framing tool and I believe it will off-load a lot of decision confusions.</li><li><b>Desktop sharing tool: </b>Screen capture and desktop sharing also works for me. I use LogMeIn and Xing. These tools offer first class feedback capturing capability from remote clients.</li></ol><div>I also try to follow some general rules:</div><div><ol><li>Always have a prioritized list of points that I want to discuss.</li><li>Be on time.</li><li>Never stay disconnected for more than 3 business days.</li></ol><div>I am sure out-sourcing will keep growing in the coming days, not only for its low cost but also for the fact that they are getting smarter and equally competent as people who charge many folds compared to them. I also anticipate a lot of out-sourcing job will go to individuals or 2/3 person groups, may be not from fortune 500 companies, but there are still other unfortunate millions of companies who will need such small teams. If you plan to work remotely, I am sure you will need some of the above tools, and if you are already in the business and think you have other good tools, please share with me.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

If you are like me, with little creativity with UI (!), on a new project you always start with a simple layout, banner followed by a row of menu and then a two column body that ends with a footer. Well, here is an example:-<div>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</div><div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="white-space: normal; color: rgb(0, 153, 0); ">CampZero<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">     </span></span></span></div><div><i><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#006600;">zero hassle camping</span></i></div><div>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#3366FF;">Home </span>| <span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#3366FF;">Place a booking</span></div><div>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#003333;">Welcome</span></span><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">      <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">    <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span> <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">   <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">       </span></span></span></span>|</div><div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre; ">        <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">      <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">      <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">        </span></span></span></span>|</div><div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre; ">        <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">      <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">      <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">        </span></span></span></span>|</div><div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre; ">        <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">      <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">      <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">        </span></span></span></span>|</div><div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre; ">        <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">      <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">      <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">        </span></span></span></span>|</div><div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre; ">        <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">      <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">      <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">        </span></span></span></span>|<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span></div><div>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</div><div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:x-small;">    </span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:x-small;">Campzero.com, all rights reserved</span></div><div>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</div><div>Well, there are other ways and you will almost always see good visual elements in most websites. However, somehow all of these beautiful sites come with some sort of menu. This post is about a site that doesn&#8217;t have a menu at all.</div><div><b>Yes it is possible to create a web app without a menu. </b>The application that I recently developed is designed around an intuitive workflow. The workflow itself drives the app and it does so without any menu. For example, on landing you see a dashboard with three sections. Main section shows highlights of different projects, sidebar contains the search box and top part contains profile card. Now, you can navigate the whole application from here. For example, select a project you will see main section with the project latest activities and the search box will search in the scope of the project.</div><div>The point is, if you know the users of your app will most likely follow one of a few workflows, then you can design a UI that flows naturally.</div><div><br /></div></div>

Excellent post.. In my opinion a most intuitive UI is the key for attracting the users most. I wish to have some knowledge about UI engineering shortly.</div>

I worked on the following story:-<blockquote><div></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;As a</span> partner, <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">when</span> I visit a project&#8217;s dashboard I <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">want</span> to see five most recently started or updated discussion threads with number of unread comments, if any. If any of these are new, I want to see them in a highlighted view. Next, if I open the thread, I want to see all new comments in a highlighted view as well. However, once seen, the threads/comments should no longer be highlighted from the rest.&#8221;</div></blockquote><div></div><div>I used the following steps to implement this.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Step#1: Added a model MessageReadTime (message_id, user_id, last_read_at)</span></div><div><pre class="brush: rails">class Message <br />has_many :messages_read_times <br />end</pre></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Step#2: Added filters in the messages_controller</span></div><div><pre class="brush: rails">after_filter :update_message_read_time, :only => [:show]<br />def update_message_read_time<br />read_time = MessageReadTime.find_or_create_by_message_id_and_user_id( params[:id], current_user.id)<br />read_time.last_read_at = Time.now<br />read_time.save!<br />end</pre></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Step#3: Added :touch=>true and unread? function in Comment class</span></div><div><pre class="brush: rails">class Comment<br />..<br />belongs_to :message, :touch => true<br />def unread?(user)<br /> read_time = self.message.message_read_times.find_by_user_id(user_id)<br /> return true unless(read_time)<br /> return read_time.last_read_at < (updated_at || created_at)       end   end</pre></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Step#4: Added unread_comments method in Message class like this</span></div><div><pre class="brush:rails">class Message<br />...<br />def unread_comments(user)<br />self.comments.collect{|comment| comment.unread?(user) ? comment : nil }.compact<br />end<br /><br />def unread?(user)<br />read_time = self.message_read_times.find_by_user_id(user.id)<br />return true unless read_time<br />return self.updated_at >= read_time.last_read_at<br />end<br />...<br />end</pre></div><div>This is it!

Previously I used a few plugins in RoR projects including <a href="http://scrumpad.com/">ScrumPad</a>. On a more recent work, I found the following plugins to be really useful and easy to get started:-<div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">1.

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; ">This intro is from the presenters:-<br /><blockquote>PAS was a joint venture development initiative by 4 major oil and gas<br />companies and CGI. Devon, Encana, Husky and Talisman joined with CGI to<br />develop a new Production and Revenue Application. Each company put 3 senior<br />business resources on the project. The development component of the PAS<br />initiative cost $35M over 5 years with up to 90 people on the team. This<br />presentation is on how we used Agile to achieve this mammoth undertaking.<br /><br />The product is currently running in production at 5 major oil and gas<br />companies with great reviews. It is also in production for several mid and<br />smaller sized companies. CGI is currently marketing the product.</blockquote>This was my first ever meet with the <a href="http://www.calgaryagile.com/">Calgary agile methods user group, CAMUG</a> and it was a great experience. Off late, I have been looking for my graduate research topic on agile methods, especially around scaling agile beyond a single team and this was just a perfect session for me.</span><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">I noted down a few of their discussed topics that I would like to share with my readers:</span></div><div><ol><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; ">The project continued in dev mode for 5 years, a $35M project.</span><br /></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; ">It started with only 3 members and extended to a team of 90 following Scrum+XP.</span><br /></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">The project had 5 sponsoring companies or clients.</span></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">They had 6 teams working in the same sprint cycles.</span></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">In each team, there were significant members from the business working full time with the team onsite and in the same open-space arrangement.</span></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">They had some 3000+ unit tests and also 300+ acceptance test.</span></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">They automated all repetitive tests.</span></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">The had external experts visiting them from time to time. Eric Evans once visited them and helped them getting better grasp on Domain Driven Design.</span></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">There had been a $800K and one month deviation from the projected cost and timeline.</span></li></ol><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; ">They also discussed some issues related to working in a multi-team, multi-client project. I remember the following ones:-</span></div><div><ol><li>They had to balance between features/bug fixes.</li><li>The deployment was taken care of by the respective sponsors, not the teams.</li><li>They had issues with sprint backlog management.</li></ol><div>They highlighted some aspects with great emphasis:-</div><div><ol><li>Open communication is the key to success.</li><li>Onsite and full time real user availability is very important for such a big project.</li><li>Automated tests, partial pair programming and continuous integration is a big plus.</li><li>Staying co-located was really helpful.</li></ol><div>What about scaling beyond?</div><div><ol><li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">I asked them, if they felt it would still be a similar success if there had been 12 teams or even more with 200 people or so. They said, it would be challenging.</span> But in response, they also said, following waterfall would make life much harder with such a big team, if at all it could be a success at the first place! Yes, I also believe this.</li><li>One of the audiences asked if they outsourced a part of the project and the response was &#8216;No&#8217;. CGI has a big team in India with a very high CMM ranking, but the project manager and asst. project manager said, it would be much difficult for differing time zones. Also, it would be difficult to transfer the knowledge as well as replicate the value of onsite client presence. The development manager also added that, the cultural difference between an agile and CMM setup would also been an issue if they had to go for the off-shore team.</li></ol><div>The session was much more eventful than what I could compile. So, if you are anywhere near Calgary and interested about meeting agile practitioners from the industry, lets meet at the next meet! </div></div></div><div><br /></div></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; "> </span><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"> </span></div></div>
