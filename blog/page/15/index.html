This is sounding very strange to me indeed! 37Signals is very much known for creating the simplest of interfaces and I really found people finding it very intuitive. But this is strange&#8230; now they are asking people to buy a book for $10 to learn how to use Basecamp! Can you believe it? See the sales post (!) here at&nbsp;<a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/typepad/37signals/products/~3/jK7OxAFFZ84/sams-teach-yourself-basecamp-in-10-minutes-is-a-comprehensive-guide-to-basecamp.html">&#8220;Sams Teach Yourself Basecamp in 10 Minutes&#8221; is a comprehensive guide to Basecamp</a></div>

Hi Ashic, thanks for stopping by!<br />They claim to have 3 million users on Basecamp. I think $20K is not something that makes them any richer!<br />In fact I would think it gives a wrong signal, like you need to learn by reading a book to use Basecamp, what people seem to know anyways!</div>

In my previous post, I listed a few <a href="http://smsohan.blogspot.com/2010/02/ruby-on-rails-interview-questions.html">general interview questions for Ruby on Rails</a> jobs. This one is intended to be more of an advanced level, not for the rookies :-)<br /><br /><ol><li>What is Rack?</li><li>Sketch out a deployment architecture of a Ruby on Rails application utilizing multiple servers.</li><li>How can you secure a rails application to counter for Session Fixation?</li><li>Where can I get the core rails framework source code?</li><li>How can you reuse the models from one rails project into another?</li><li>Explain one plugin that you extracted out of your source code.</li><li>What is the difference between pre-initializers and initializers?</li><li>How can you easily switch your logger to use Log4r?</li><li>How would you design the logging standard for your rails application?</li><li>How can you implement asynchronous messaging in Rails?</li><li>What will you do to look for a possible memory leak in Rails application?</li><li>How can you run a profiler?</li><li>What is lambda?</li><li>What is Proc? When did you use this?</li><li>How can you use before and after callbacks of your rails methods to halt a database insert/update/delete?</li><li>How can you reuse your before and after callback methods across multiple models?</li><li>Define an architecture to store files uploaded to an application so that they are only accessible to valid users.</li><li>How would you change your asset storage to use a static server?</li><li>Explain one situation when you used rails caching.</li><li>What kinds of caching comes in-built with Rails?</li><li>Can you explain the use of &#8216;dynamic&#8217; features of Ruby on the core Rails framework?</li><li>How can you call a SOAP web service from a rails application?</li><li>Your application needs to send a lot of email notifications. How would you design the notification so that the end user doesn&#8217;t get stuck for email sending delays?</li><li>What is a mongrel cluster?</li><li>Can you explain if the clusters share a same memory? Can one cluster handle a request from a client that was handled by another?</li><li>How would you internationalize your application interface?</li><li>How can you create a rails generator?</li><li>Have you ever used a polymorphic association?</li><li>How can you define a plugin that adds a new class method to ActiveRecord::Base?</li><li>What are the three most significant changes in Rails 3 in your eyes?</li><li>How can you implement complex reporting using ruby on rails?</li></ol><div>I am sure this list will go on and on. But I have found most people asking questions about scalability, deployment issues, security and such architectural level questions to extract out the in-depth understanding of such core concepts. Where to learn more on such advanced stuffs?&nbsp;<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails Guides</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ruby-on-rails">Stack Overflow</a> are my favorite places. However, its good to keep an eye on the edge rails to see what&#8217;s happening today!&nbsp;</div></div>

<b>Ruby Specific Questions</b><br />The best place for learning ruby is to get started with the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/">programming-ruby</a>. It fairly covers the important bits in a very readable language. Here are a few quick questions on ruby:<br /><ol><li>What is rubygems?</li><li>What is a Symbol?</li><li>What is the difference between a Symbol and String?</li><li>What is the purpose of yield?</li><li>How do you define class variables?</li><li>How do you define instance variables?</li><li>How do you define global variables?</li><li>How can you dynamically define a method body?</li><li>What is a Range?</li><li>How can you implement method overloading?</li><li>What is the difference between &#8216;&amp;&amp;&#8217; and &#8216;and&#8217; operators?</li><li>What is the convention for using &#8216;!&#8217; at the end of a method name?</li><li>What is a module?</li><li>What is mixin?</li><li>How will you implement a singleton pattern?</li><li>How will you implement a observer pattern?</li><li>How can you define a constant?</li><li>How can you define a custom Exception?</li><li>How can you fire a method when a module is included inside a class?</li><li>What is the default access modifier (public/protected/private) for a method?</li><li>How can you call the base class method from inside of its overriden method?</li></ol><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Rails Specific Questions</span><br />A thorough reading of the articles at&nbsp;<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails Guides</a>&nbsp;can be very useful for starters as well as a refresher for veterans. The following bunch of questions are specific to rails, in no particular order. The <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/">Pragmatic Bookshelf</a> has a fantastic book for beginners called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pragprog.com/frequently-asked-questions/ebooks">Agile Web Development Using Ruby on Rails</a>.<br /><ol><li>Define the Rails MVC implementation using an example.</li><li>What is a named scope? (or Scope in Rails 3).</li><li>Can you give an example of a class that should be inside the lib folder?</li><li>Where should you put code that is supposed to run when your application launches?</li><li>What deployment tool do you use?</li><li>How can you migrate your database schema one level down?</li><li>What is an observer?</li><li>What is a sweeper?</li><li>How can you implement caching in Rails?</li><li>What is a filter? When it is called?</li><li>How can you divide your controllers into separate modules?</li><li>What is RESTful routing?</li><li>How can you list all routes for an application?</li><li>How can you send a multi-part email?</li><li>Is it possible to embed partial views inside layouts? How?</li><li>What is the purpose of RJS?</li><li>How can you create a REST API for your application?</li><li>How can you define a new environment called &#8216;staging&#8217;?</li><li>What is Rake?</li><li>What is Capistrano?</li><li>What is a polymorophic association?</li><li>How can you implement a polymorphic association?</li><li>What is a has and belongs to many association?</li><li>What is the difference between has_one and belongs_to?</li><li>How can you implement single table inheritance?</li><li>What is eager loading?</li><li>How can you eager load associated objects?</li><li>How can you add a custom validation on your model?</li><li>How can you implement a custom theme for your forms?</li><li>Why is fields_for used for?</li><li>What is the purpose of a helper method?</li><li>What is flash?</li><li>How can you install the missing gems that are required by your application in the simplest way?</li><li>How can you implement internationalization?</li><li>How can you show search user friendly urls instead of using only numeric ids?</li><li>How can you configure your application for different environments?</li><li>How can you instruct rails logger to ignore passwords and such fields while logging?</li></ol><br /><b>Test Frameworks</b><br />Ruby on Rails has a number of built-in and a few other third-party test frameworks. Here are a few sample questions on such frameworks:<br /><ol><li>Are you familiar with unit testing?</li><li>How does functional testing differ from unit testing?</li><li>Have you ever used a mocking framework?</li><li>Are you familiar with BDD using RSpec or Cucumber?</li><li>What is an alternative to using test fixtures?</li><li>How can you reuse part of a text fixture?</li><li>How do you specify associations in the test fixture yml files?</li></ol><br /><b>Plugins</b><br />Plugins are the principal mechanism to reuse code. The open-source community is at full-bloom when it comes about plugins. The <a href="http://railsplugins.org/plugins">Rails Plugins site</a> has a really good list of such plugins from the community.<br /><ol><li>What plugin would you recommend for user authentication and authorization?</li><li>What plugin do you use for full-text search?</li><li>How can you implement a state machine?</li><li>What is the difference between a plugin and a gem?</li><li>How can you create a plugin?</li><li>Can you please name a few useful plugins?</li><li>How can you implement a search feature that searches for multiple models?</li><li>How can you upload a flie to a server?</li></ol><br /><b>Architecture Related Questions</b><br />This questions can be from different angles like: quality, security, scalability, manageability, interoperability, reusability and all the other ilities you name! Here are a few example questions:<br /><ol><li>Is Rails scalable?</li><li>What are the key deployment challenges?</li><li>How can you safeguard a rails application from SQL injection attack?</li><li>How can you secure a rails application?</li><li>How can rails engage with a SOA platform?</li></ol><br /><b>Community Related Questions</b><br />I see a fairly large community on <a href="http://github.com/languages/Ruby">Github</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, <a href="http://railscasts.com/">RailsCasts</a>, <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/">The Riding Rails Blog</a>&nbsp;and many more. Some interviewers may want to see if you are connected to the community. The following questions may help you prepare :-)<br /><ol><li>Can you tell me a few good community resources for Rails?</li><li>Where would you reach out to get the community to answer your questions?</li><li>What&#8217;s new in Rails 3.0?</li><li>Which famous applications are built using ruby on rails?</li></ol><div>I plan to polish this document on a later revision. But in the meanwhile, if you feel like contributing, you can start commenting with the answers, more questions or suggestions. I believe this will not only help people getting ready for their next Rails job, but also for everyone to see what knowledge we are missing&#8230;<br />Disclaimer: This is not a shortcut, rather its kind of a check list that may help you with an interview.</div></div>

At times I wanted to push some files with my blog so that people can download and check something locally. Up until now, it was not a straight-forward way. I either uploaded the file to my own server or google pages or somewhere. Then linked it on the blog.<br />However, you can now publish files from <a href="http://skydrive.live.com/">Windows Live SkyDrive</a>&nbsp;(total free space of 25 GB)&nbsp;or <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a> (Total free space 1GB). If you haven&#8217;t checked already, google now offers you the opportunity to upload any kind of file without conversion. I know there are other services like this, but these two should be reliable.<br />I took some information from this <a href="http://www.itwriting.com/blog/2082-store-any-type-of-file-in-google-apps-in-effect-gdrive.html">Tim Anderson&#8217;s ITWriting blog</a>.</div>

Recently I had the opportunity to review a ruby on rails code. The project aims to create an online market place for experts, with a similar model to some other freelancing/outsourcing sites. Here is how and what I reviewed:<br />I had a read-only access to the code and no download was allowed locally. So, I didn&#8217;t get to run the code, tests or any tool to auto-generate some reports on the code. Also, it was supposed to be a high level review and I was supposed to take 5 hours to take a look into the code and write a report on the various aspects of it. In the end, it took me 6 hours and I came up with a 14 page report. I liked this job for a few reasons:<br /><br /><ol><li>When I was working at <a href="http://www.ScrumPad.com/">www.ScrumPad.com</a>&nbsp;project, we got our code reviewed by Gregg Pollack of <a href="http://railsenvy.com/">RailsEnvy</a>. During those days we had little experience on RoR before we started the project. So, we ended up with something that was working well, but wasn&#8217;t the best one in terms of confidence and reliability. I remember the review was very well-thought and presented by Gregg and that to a great extent shaped the later works on the project.</li><li>This was my first official assignment as a reviewer.</li><li>I was excited to see how other people were approaching their RoR projects.</li></ol>&nbsp;Now coming to my review approach, here you go:<br /><br /><ol><li>After some googling about reviewing RoR applications, I didn&#8217;t find any comprehensive suggestion and decided to go my own way.</li><li>To get started, I took a look into the <b>config/routes.rb</b> file. I had the impression that, routes.rb would help me understand the resources and their relationships. But soon I discovered one potential issue as there were almost no nesting of resources and some resources had tens of actions apart from the standard RESTful methods.</li><li>Next, I picked the resource with most number of methods and found that, it was actually taking the responsibility of 5 different resources. Although these resources were somewhat related, it made little sense to me to have such FAT controllers.</li><li>I was also looking for <b>logging, exception handling, ruby coding style, naming</b> and came up with some suggestions to improve on these aspects.</li><li>I also suggested them to <b>modularize their controllers</b>. They already had an admin module, but they could introduce more to clean up things.</li><li>After controllers, I went to the <b>models</b>. By the time I found a few <b>natural inheritance relations</b> among the models. But the relations were not found in the models that ended up with a number of <b>code duplications</b> and similar looking branches at several places. So, I suggested them to install the relations using <b>single table inheritance</b> and cleanup the stuffs.</li><li>Apart from the relations, I also found a number of <b>self or class methods</b> floating here and there. While ActiveRecord models themselves offer a number of such methods, its not always wise to create one without thinking. In the code I found self methods resulted in method duplication and <b>wrong method placement</b> at several places.</li><li>Next coming to views, I found they did a good job with the helpers and partials. Views were better organized. But also, I found <b>a lot, I mean a lot, of partials</b>. Such an explosion of partials often makes it hard to find the right ones, especially for new comers.</li><li>Going to test code, I found they had a test suite with unit, functional and integration tests. But the amount of test was a concern for me. I believe test codes are there to help good design practices and managing changes over time. I suggested them to <b>target 80% test coverage</b> at a minimum.</li><li>Coming about <b>deployment</b>, I found they were using manual deployment techniques. I suggested them to use <a href="http://www.capify.org/">capistrano</a>&nbsp;for deployment.</li><li>Overall I found a lot of reinventing the wheel scenario as they could get rid of lots of code by just using commonly known and free <b>plugins</b>. I suggested some plugins in this regard.</li><li>I suggested them to use <b>named_scopes</b> to get rid of some self methods here and there.</li></ol>After the review, I felt such patterns in RoR code is expected to surface in most new to RoR teams. Although experienced and smart people often read articles and consult experts as an on going basis to get things right at the first place. I suggest every team, if they haven&#8217;t already gone through, to take some time and study the resources at <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">http://guides.rubyonrails.org</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/">http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/</a><br />Also, its a good idea to know the Ruby language fluently to make use of the power of the language. A good learning resource comes with ruby installation named <b>Programming Ruby</b>, also available in the internet at <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/">http://ruby-doc.org</a><br /><a href="http://ruby-doc.org/"></a>As a continuous learning tool, I also suggest keeping an eye on <a href="http://railscasts.com/">http://railscasts.com</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ruby-on-rails">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ruby-on-rails</a></div>

If you are anything like me, you love using the home and end key to quickly move to the start/end of a line of text. But, in Apple MacBook Pro, there is no default home/end key! I searched the internet and found Command + Left/Right to the rescue on OS X.<br /><div>But, then I installed windows 7 on my Mac and it was nightmare to edit without the home/end keys. Today I just found that you can use<b><span style="color: red;"> fn+ Left/Right</span></b> for this purpose! Hurray! It makes my time with Microsoft office and Visual studio much happier, again :-)<br /><div><br /></div></div></div>

According to google&#8217;s SEO guideline, its a good idea to provide breadcrumbs to your web contents. This is good in two ways: a) It helps people to find path to move up the navigation stack and b) it helps the google and other search engines to get a feel about your web content&#8217;s hierarchical organization.<div>To add this breadcrumbs support, in my application <a href="http://www.campzero.com/">www.campzero.com</a>, a going to be online service marketplace for Bangladesh, I simply used the Crummy plugin. You can take a look at the <a href="http://github.com/zachinglis/crummy/">Crummy plugin at github</a>. It took me less than 10 minutes to find, learn and use this plugin! You can see the plugin in action at the <a href="http://www.campzero.com/service_categories/3-Catering-service-Bangladesh/services">campzero site</a>.</div><div>I recommend this plugin for your Ruby on Rails breadcrumbs needs!</div></div>

When talking about Search Engine Optimization for your public web pages, you probably try to follow the google guidelines for search engine optimization. Its a good one to get started with. For my recent project, <a href="http://www.campzero.com/">www.campzero.com</a>, I read the document and tried to follow the steps. Today, I worked on generating sitemap for www.campzero.com using the following:<ul><li>Installed the site-map generator plugin following this link at <a href="http://aktagon.com/projects/rails/sitemap-generator">Aktagon&#8217;s</a>, <a href="http://github.com/christianhellsten/sitemap-generator">github link</a></li><li>For some reason, probably because of permission issues, my plugin install didn&#8217;t generate the sample sitemap.yml file for me. However, I created the config/sitemap.yml file myself and put the following contents there:</li></ul><pre class="brush: rails">domain: www.campzero.com<br />limit: 5000<br />priority: 1<br />change_frequency: weekly</pre><ul><li>Then, I put the call to the sitemap method as shown in the github documentation. </li><li>Finally, I ran the command <b>rake sitemap:gerenate</b> to generate my sitemap.xml file inside the public folder.</li><li>So far this went well with the local environment. However, when I deployed this code and ran the rake command in my staging environment, it said it was not finding any model with the sitemap method.</li><li>After some debugging, I found that the problem was with the code at the file generator.rb where they put <b>model.methods.include?(&#8216;sitemap_options&#8217;) </b>to see if the model contains a method named sitemap_options. But, at my staging environment, I found that this was returning false although there was this method inside the model. I changed the code to the following so that the include? check is done both for strings and symbols and it worked fine.</li></ul><pre class="brush: rails">if((model.methods.include?(:sitemap_options) || model.methods.include?('sitemap_options')) &amp;&amp; model.sitemap_options != nil)<br />models &lt;&lt; model<br />end</pre><ul><li>Now, I could generate sitemap at my staging environment.</li><li>However, soon I found another issue with deployment, as I want my sitemap file to stay between deployments. So, I had to ensure the sitemap file is generated at a shared place other than the default public folder. I did the following changes to the sitemap_generator_task.rake file:</li></ul><pre class="brush: rails">if defined?(SITEMAP_FILE_PATH)<br />SitemapGenerator::Generator.new(SITEMAP_FILE_PATH).find_models_and_generate<br />else<br />SitemapGenerator::Generator.run<br />end</pre><div><ul><li>I added the constant SITEMAP_FILE_PATH in my config/environments/staging.rb file to get it working.</li><li>Finally, I changed my deployment script to define a symlink from the public folder to the shared file path as follows:</li></ul><div><b>run &#8220;ln -s #{shared_path}/sitemap/sitemap.xml #{release_path}/public/sitemap.xml&#8221;</b></div></div></div>

Recently, I had the following requirements as I was working on CampZero.com - the going to be service marketplace of Bangladesh.<div><ol><li>Remove all html tags other than hyperlinks and new lines from a html fragment</li><li>Truncate the text to show only first 200 characters of the text and append ellipsis (&#8230;) in case the text was truncated.</li><li>Highlight an array of words in the text to show the search query worlds that matched</li></ol><div>The first one, getting rid of all but hyperlinks and new lines was achieved by the following code:</div><pre class="brush: rails"><br />&lt;%= sanitize my_html_text, :tags => %w(br a) %&gt;<br /></pre><div>Next, to truncate the text, I simply used the following:</div><div><pre class="brush: rails"><br />&lt;%= truncate my_sanitized_text, :length => 200 %&gt;<br /></pre></div><div>Lastly, to highlight my search query words, I did the following</div><pre class="brush: rails"><br />#in the controller<br />@query_words = params[:query] ? params[:query].split(/\W/) : ''<br />#in the view</pre></div><div><div>In reality, I chained the above thee methods as shown below:</div><div><pre class="brush: rails">&lt;%= highlight(truncate(sanitize(my_html_text, :tags => %w(br a)), :length => 200), @query_words) %&gt;</pre></div><div>These methods and their siblings are great as time savers. Rails makes the web development fun by including this as built in methods.
