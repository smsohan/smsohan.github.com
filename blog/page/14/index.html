Ryan Bates had a series of posts (<a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/225-upgrading-to-rails-3-part-1">1</a>, <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/226-upgrading-to-rails-3-part-2">2</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/227-upgrading-to-rails-3-part-3">3</a>) on upgrading your Rails 2.3.x apps to Rails 3.x and sure they are useful. But if you are really doing that, beware of the following changes that you will need to do. It will take a lot of time for sure if you you have a moderate sized app.<br /><br />Upgrading your models:<br /><br /><ol><li>Get rid of all validates_xxx_of with appropriate validates</li><li>Get rid of all def validate &#8230; end methods with custom validator</li><li>Find out all occurrences of :conditions, :limit, :order and use new active record methods instead</li><li>Replace all named_scope with scope</li><li>Make sure your acts_as_xxxx plugins are all updated to use Ruby on Rails 3. I had troubles with Authlogic as it shows Based.named_scope is DEPRICATED. Still looking for a solution.</li><li>Ruby 1.9.2 doesn&#8217;t work with soap42 wsdl driver. Haven&#8217;t found a solution yet as it keeps reporting an error regarding &#8220;XML processor module&#8221; missing.</li></ol><div>Upgrading your controllers:</div><div><ol><li>Find out all occurrences of find method and replace with where.</li><li>Find out all calls to Mailer that looks like deliver_xxx and make it xxx.deliver</li></ol><div><div><div>Upgrading your views:</div></div><div><ol><li>All erb blocks must start with a   has to be changed to&nbsp; . Do the same for all such erb blocks with a do.</li><li>All link_to_remote or remote_form_for or other remote form helpers need to be changed to their non-remote counterparts with a param :remote =&gt; true.</li></ol></div></div><div>Upgrading your mailers:</div></div><div><ol><li>body method is gone, instead of the hashed params to this method, just define instance variables.</li><li>All xxx.text.html.erb now becomes xxx.html.erb in the mailer views.</li></ol><div>Upgrading the config files:</div></div><div><ol><li>The best way is to crate a new rails app and then copy the config folder into yours.</li><li>Look at the initializers and clean up any required initializers.</li><li>Make sure you have autoload_paths setup to include the lib folder. It is not included by default, so your code from the lib folder won&#8217;t be accessible.</li><li>Look at deprecation warning and you will see lots of config.action_controller.* need to changed to config.*</li></ol><div>Plugins:</div></div><div><ol><li>All plugin/lib/rails/tasks/*.rake needs to be copied in to plugin/lib/tasks/*.rake</li><li>Make sure your plugins don&#8217;t use named_scope, if you find any, replace with scope.</li><li>Whatever applies to your models should also be applied to your plugins that act on models.</li></ol><div>Testing:</div><div><ol><li>Check you have updated shoulda, rspec or whatever lib you use.</li><li>Update test codes according to your new lib.</li></ol></div><div>Upgrading IDE to use RVM:</div></div><div><ol><li>Your IDE is not smart enough to use RVM. However <a href="http://blendedmusings.blogspot.com/2010/10/getting-rvm-textmate-ruby-187-and-192.html">use this</a> to get TextMate ready.</li></ol></div></div>

Here is a sample UML class diagram of the situation that posed me the OO design dilemma a few days ago.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Gr1ozXzBWpM/TJFBU_9fSvI/AAAAAAAAAR4/P_vohuF54gQ/s1600/Picture+1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="227" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Gr1ozXzBWpM/TJFBU_9fSvI/AAAAAAAAAR4/P_vohuF54gQ/s640/Picture+1.png" width="640" /></a></div>Let me explain with an example,<br /><blockquote>The <b>Electronic Items</b> catalog has many <b>Televisions</b>. The Sony Televisions come with different <b>specifications</b>, such as refresh rate of 240 Hz, 120 Hz and 60 Hz. However, the 240 Hz ones also comes in different <b>colors</b> - Black and Grey.</blockquote>Now, a store manager needs to see the recent changes across all catalogs, such as electronic items, musical instruments and so on. So, if someone added a new Sony 240 Hz color of Dark Black or removed the Grey one, the store manager needs to see this. However, a department manager may need to see changes at all levels, for example whenever one of her Catalog, Product, Specification or its Property is changed. So, if she needs to see all changes under Sony Television, you know, she needs to see changes in the name and value of underlying specifications and their properties as well as changes at the higher level, say, the price.<br /><br />Now, the above design looks good from OO perspective. However, since we need to persist the data into a relational database, we will end up with one table per class and foreign keys to interlink. If you are doing Ruby on Rails, you will possibly use polymorphic association between Auditable and the subclasses. For an example, lets consider the following E-R design (not showing all relations):<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Gr1ozXzBWpM/TJFE56rQeUI/AAAAAAAAASA/DuAVnIfhJ74/s1600/Picture+2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="207" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Gr1ozXzBWpM/TJFE56rQeUI/AAAAAAAAASA/DuAVnIfhJ74/s400/Picture+2.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />Now, given this schema, if you need to find out the latest 50 Log Messages with Author and Associated objects for the Electronics Catalog, how would you write a simple query?<br /><br />Look, here is an expected outcome of the query:<br />Sep 15, 2010<br /><br /><ol><li>Jane added new Color : Dark Black for Sony 240 Hz TV</li><li>Shon changed the Sony TV Price from $700 to $600</li><li>Jakie added a new Specification for Panasonic TV: Aspect Ratio -&gt; 16:9</li></ol>Sep 14, 2010<br /><br /><ol><li>&#8230;</li><li>&#8230;</li></ol><br /><br />Now, you see, the date wise grouping can be done once the latest audit logs from all across the Catalog hierarchy is found. But how do you find it given a CatalogID to start with? The following query wont work:<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><b>SELECT TOP 50 * FROM Auditables WHERE AuditableTypeName=&#8217;Catalog&#8217; and AuditableID=my_catalog_id ORDER BY Timestamp DESC</b></span><br /><br />Because it will only produce the audit logs for the Catalog Object, whereas we are expecting to see all the recent audits for this Catalog and underlying products down to the Specification Property level.<br /><br />However, one work around is to query for the Audit Logs for the Catalog. Next, find all the Products of this Catalog and query for the audits for all these products. However, if we are to select top 50 audits for the catalog and its whole hierarchy, how many should we select here? And the problem gets even worse, &nbsp;when you have to repeat the above steps for Specifications and Specification Properties. When you have to take the latest 50 audit logs after you run a few queries, say 10, you have to take 50 audit logs for each &nbsp;of them. Because, the latest 50 results can be from a single query :-(<br /><br />Looks like the Auditable class and corresponding design doesn&#8217;t work well for this situation. So, what is a possible solution?<br /><br />It&#8217;s hard. I don&#8217;t readily see a great solution. However, workarounds are there. For example, we can change the Audiable class to hold references to all levels of the Catalog object hierarchy. So, in that case the Auditables table will look like the following:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Gr1ozXzBWpM/TJFJLW-zqpI/AAAAAAAAASI/-daGa5FRXTI/s1600/Picture+3.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Gr1ozXzBWpM/TJFJLW-zqpI/AAAAAAAAASI/-daGa5FRXTI/s320/Picture+3.png" /></a></div><br />With such a schema, we need to ensure if the Audit Log corresponds to a SpecificationProperty, we put references to all its higher level objects. So, the query will be simple. With this assumption, the following query will be able to fetch all audit logs for Catalog and its descendants.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">SELECT TOP 50 * FROM Auditables WHERE CatalogID=my_catalog_id</span></b><br /><br />Similarly, the following query will produce the audit logs for a single project and its descendents:<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">SELECT TOP 50 * FROM Auditables WHERE ProductID=my_product_id</span></b><br /><br />However, it has its downsides as well. The Auditables is no longer a general purpose Auditable. If we add a new type of Auditable, we cannot use it unless we alter its properties! High Coupling! Less Reuse. Also, a lot of if-else will be required to show the Audit logs, as it can belong to multiple parents!<br /><br />How would you solve this design dilemma? Comments welcome!</div>

So, enemies will seemingly look like your friends until the moment when.. well, its time for the kill! My dear readers, its time to know the enemies!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I have met with a few enemies off late. I will go one by one here.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">If you are a software developer like me, you will often see this enemy, camouflaged variables, methods, classes and namespaces. For example, I have recently seen a Stack camouflaged as Visitor! I really mean this. I found a class called Visitor, so I was expecting a Visitor Design Pattern implementation or something similar, but what I got was a Stack under the hood with two methods Push and Pop! This enemies are very bad for your health, as they will keep you guessing all the time&#8230; you never know what they do from looking at their names!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Another enemy you will often see are the very skinny ones, to skinny to have any meat in them. I met some enemies like this as well. What happens when you do over engineering with interface explosion and a lot of one method classes? Is it really that difficult? Is it really a class? Is it really a package? I don&#8217;t think so! You can spoil a piece of code by introducing a class/package for a single method. This enemy often surfaces because of the fact that, the design pattern book only shows classes with one/two key methods in them&#8230; which is of course not intended. But this is life&#8230; you gotta balance between class explosion and God classes&#8230; really, or this enemy will kill you someday.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I have just touched two common enemies&#8230; but there is another enemy we all are aware of, CMD+c (OS X) or Ctrl + C (Win). Its such a pain to copy a code fragment and use it in a different class&#8230; this is exactly the form of reuse that kills everything. Make sure you don&#8217;t let this germ to grow, or it will outgrow you and leave you crying.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Have you reviewed your code by someone else today? If yes, keep up the good work. If not, beware of the enemies before they get you. Best of luck!</div></div>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.fifa.com/mm/photo/tournament/competition/01/26/98/56/1269856%5ffull-lnd.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="216" src="http://www.fifa.com/mm/photo/tournament/competition/01/26/98/56/1269856%5ffull-lnd.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>FIFA world cup 2010 is almost coming to an end. This is definitely the greatest show on earth and I have been all occupied with the matches&#8230;<br /><br />However, the show started almost immediately after I was back from Europe. It was a nice tour, starting a day at Amsterdam. Then to Trondheim (Norway), Stockholm and the best part was the night long sea cruise to Helsinki. An experience to remember for the rest of my life.<br /><br />The days were eventful to say the least. At XP 2010, I presented my paper. Here is the presentation for my caring readers :-)<br /><br /><iframe frameborder="0" height="342" src="http://docs.google.com/present/embed?id=dghx8mpb_98czd8pcgm" width="410"></iframe><br /><br />But XP 2010 was also a great place to meet people from around the world who care about software, its crafts and of course impacts. In very short, I found people to be very interested and starting to explore the possibilities with Lean and Kanban. This was a little surprising, because until now it has almost always been Scrum and XP to have a covering meaning of Agile. But, the industry seems to be leaning towards Lean. This is the beauty of being agile, to be able to adapt with time!<br />However, Norway seemed to be an expensive place even compared to Calgary. But, don&#8217;t shy away from Norway for this reason, they have spectacular beauty in their landscape. Serene and soothing. While staying in Trondheim, I visited a cathedral from early 1000&#8217;s. It was amazing to see the cathedral still standing firmly after so many years&#8230; extreme engineering! The city was full of historical buildings&#8230; if you haven&#8217;t heard, the Harry Potter building is actually the main academic building at NTNU. (kidding! but the locals really call it by Harry Potter building)<br />This is me and my wife in front of the Harry Potter Building!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Gr1ozXzBWpM/TDT4pdKwpgI/AAAAAAAAAQE/hYe-ssiFtpY/s1600/DSC00668.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Gr1ozXzBWpM/TDT4pdKwpgI/AAAAAAAAAQE/hYe-ssiFtpY/s320/DSC00668.JPG" /></a></div><br />The city tour and canal cruise at Amsterdam was also a pleasant experience. It was nice to see the centuries old bridges and roads still serving the people so well. It is indeed a bicycle city, everyone in the city seemed to have a bicycle&#8230; believe me, they have multi-storied parking facilities only for bicycles! No wonder, why they are so healthy as a nation.<br /><br />Next, Stockholm is a city full of life. You will see people dancing, having a drink and enjoying their times with friends everywhere. Especially for people like me, who barely see any crowd in Calgary, will find the place to be very exciting and inspiring.<br /><br />Our Stockholm stay was rather short as we went to Helsinki on a sea cruise with Viking line. This was very eventful. Firstly because me and my wife lost each other when I was rushing into the ship as it was just about to start&#8230; then I stepped out of the ship, rushing back to the checkin counter and heard her crying like a baby&#8230; she was so upset and so scared! But we eventually managed to get into the ship may be 1 min before the doors were locked!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Gr1ozXzBWpM/TDT610TZ9yI/AAAAAAAAAQM/mLayVi4eP5g/s1600/DSC00798.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Gr1ozXzBWpM/TDT610TZ9yI/AAAAAAAAAQM/mLayVi4eP5g/s320/DSC00798.JPG" width="303" /></a></div>But this late entrance came with a surprise! We were given a window side cabin although we didn&#8217;t get one while booking&#8230; and the awesome journey began. It was around 5:30 in the evening and the view from the deck was so nice. And there were live music and dance uptill midnight, nice romantic trip altogether. When we landed at the Helsinki city, we roamed around the tourist hotspots and I slept on the grass. Really! I took the following photo before I fell asleep..<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Gr1ozXzBWpM/TDT7skUCdDI/AAAAAAAAAQU/CFEObS_Fi3c/s1600/DSC00851.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Gr1ozXzBWpM/TDT7skUCdDI/AAAAAAAAAQU/CFEObS_Fi3c/s320/DSC00851.JPG" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">However, back to normal life and the greatest show on earth started! At office, I have kind of wrapped up the application that I was working on for the last 3 months and now heading towards another project. This time its gonna be Java after a looong time&#8230; At the lab, trying to wrap my thesis related implementations by the summer. Discovering lot of things as I am working with Lucene, Solr, Tika, Acts as Solr and these full text search engine related stuffs. Hope to push a post about these things when I get some time!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">But, this is summer in Calgary. And I attended the Canada Day fireworks at the City hall. Here is a photo of the event for my reader:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Gr1ozXzBWpM/TDT8yE-tK1I/AAAAAAAAAQc/qBoCmechLcY/s1600/DSC00951.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Gr1ozXzBWpM/TDT8yE-tK1I/AAAAAAAAAQc/qBoCmechLcY/s320/DSC00951.JPG" /></a></div>This is pretty much it. Looking forward to the events at Calgary Stampedes. Hopefully this will also be a wonderful time pass. I will see if I can be back with some real &#8220;meat&#8221; in this blog shortly!</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I just completed my Winter 2010 semester at school. It was so far a good one. I pushed my papers and presentations on the courses of this semester at <a href="http://smsohan.com/#courses">http://smsohan.com/#courses</a>&nbsp;If you are interested to read my paper about <b>Tabletop Application Testing</b> or <b>Communication Challenges with Distributed Agile Teams</b>, you are most welcome at my site.<br /><br />However, its time to look ahead to the summer. And I hope this will be a good one! I just received my driving license after a wonderful training from Drashko and Gordana at the <a href="http://www.yellowpages.ca/bus/Alberta/Calgary/Green-Light-Driving-School/5369272.html">Green Light Driving School</a>. If you are looking for a caring and professional driving school in Calgary, I highly recommend them. They will make it easy for you.<br /><br />Well, driving license comes with an obligation to buy a car :-) I am right now looking for one used car, probably from Toyota, Honda or Nissan, as people told me these are more reliable than others. I am not sure if I will be buying a car soon, but I already got visa for a Europe trip, my first ever. Its gonna be our second honeymoon in the European land :-) We will be going to Norway for attending the XP 2010 conference where I will be presenting my research paper on <b>Email Auto-Tagging with User Stories</b>. However, we are planning to see a part of Amsterdam and Stockholm alongside Norway. I have heard all the good things about these sites during summer&#8230; staying tuned to that!<br /><br />I will also be working on my research project as well as my job at <a href="http://www.Wairever.com/">Wairever Inc</a>. This summer will be a busy one. But I am hoping the summer in Calgary will be a lot of fun with friends and at work&#8230;<br /><br /><b>One little realization:</b> I figured out that there are two crowds in the software world. One crowd has lot of respect for open source stuffs like <b>Ruby on Rails</b> and another crowd has that for &#8220;established&#8221; big players like <b>.Net or Java</b>. With this realization, I am focusing on getting my .Net knowledge in sync with recent developments as of <b>.Net 4.0 and VS 2010</b>. I am always reading the blogs and MSDN&#8230; but this time I will look into one/few books that give(s) a complete and detailed picture about the deltas in .Net 4.0. &nbsp;However, I will keep posting on my <a href="http://www.DrinkRails.com/">Drink Rails blog</a> as usual, almost daily.<br /><br />Do you have any recommended book for .Net 4.0? Please use the comments area for that.</div>

Congrats on err&#8230;everything ;)<br />I&#39;d argue there are a few more types than just those two. There are .NET junkies who respect rails. There&#39;s a reason ASP.NET MVC is so great&#8230;some of those junkies saw that webforms is shit, that Rails does web far far better and chose to bring something similar to the .NET world. The same guys are promoting patterns and practices that came about partly (if not largely) from the Rails world. I&#39;m a .NET guy, so I know that that&#39;s true. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a fourth category that goes the other way (i.e. they&#39;re OSS people who respect .NET etc.).</div>

<a href="http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic">Bynarylogic&#8217;s authlogic</a> has gained much popularity for its out of the box solution to ruby on rails authentication. Yesterday, I was working on giving API access to my ruby on rails application so that other apps can use my RESTful services. The authenticated API access usually involves the following steps:<br /><ol><li>API_KEY or a token to identify/authenticate an API call.</li><li>Authentication of an API caller using the API_KEY.</li></ol><div>Authlogic comes with in-built support for this. The following steps will do it for you:</div><div><script src="http://gist.github.com/379478.js"></script></div></div>

Well, I didn&#8217;t know this until late. If you are like me, you have often wondered when you saw those unwanted flash messages appearing after a request, sometimes after ajax requests when you do a redirect, all on a sudden that flash shows up!<br />Well, as you have thought, the Ruby on Rails people have solved this problem way before now. The solution is to wisely use flash.now[] and flash[]. Here are a few tips:<br /><br /><b>Use flash.now[] when you are flashing:</b><br /><br /><ul><li>on ajax requests</li><li>before a call to render :action =&gt; :my_action, as often found in failure cases of create and update actions</li></ul><b>Use flash[] when you are flashing:</b><br /><br /><ul><li>before a redirect_to, often found in the success cases of create and update actions</li></ul><div>In general, use flash.now[] when you don&#8217;t want to carry over the flash to the next http request and flash[] otherwise. The FlashHash class has more detail on this<a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Flash/FlashHash.html"> at the ruby on rails API page</a>. Hope this helps you to get rid of those annoying and often embarrassing out-of-context flash messages!</div></div>

Helpful explanation, thanks!<br /><br />But there&#39;s a little typo: &quot;Use flash.NEW[]&#8230;&quot; should be &quot;Use flash.NOW[]&#8230;&quot;</div>
