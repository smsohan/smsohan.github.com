  <div class="entry-content"><p>Finally, I defended my PhD thesis yesterday. Family, friends, and
colleagues are all sending their wishes, and it feels great to have
crossed this milestone.</p>

<p>To be honest, deep inside, I carry a sad and guilty feeling, which at
times overshadows the feeling of acomplishment. This phenomenon is hard
to write about, but I wanted to give it a try anyway.</p>

<p>So, it was 2012. Life was good. I got promoted to Senior Consultant at
ThoughtWorks and Shahana got a job almost immediately following the
completion of her grad school. We spent an amazing vacation to end the
year 2011, and the summer of 2012 was full of weekend trips to all the
beautiful touristy places. That summer we also found that we were gonna
be first time parents. It was an exciting time.</p>

<p>Along came fall. It started getting cold and wintery in Calgary. Both of
us would be home by 5:30 PM, and would look for things to do to keep
busy till bed time, which is about midnight. With slippery and often
icy sidewalk, going for walks oudoors would mean a serious risk for the
soon-to-be mom. So, we mostly stayed indoors. We were naive, and didn&#8217;t
quite learn to enjoy the serenity of the &#8220;nothing to do&#8221; time. So, in
one of such evenings, out of sheer boredom, I decided to shoot an email
to my then ex-supervisor asking if he could meet to discuss potentially
a part-time PhD admission for me.</p>

<p>He wrote back and we meet next week. He was quick to accept that request
and also ensured that he&#8217;d be able to pay my tuition and expences as a
scholarship, if required, for the full four years. I discussed this with
Shahana and we decided to take this opportunity. Officially, the program
would start in Fall 2013, about 5 months after the due date of our
first born.</p>

<p>This is going to be a long read. But I&#8217;m writing it while it&#8217;s fresh in
my memory from this overwhelmingly emotional time that I&#8217;m going through
since the exam yesterday. This write up is an attempt to dump the
different incidents that are showing up like storms in my mind at this
time. I think it&#8217;s written for myself, more than anything. But I
appologize if you&#8217;re reading this, since it&#8217;s a long format story, the
format that most people don&#8217;t like to read online.</p>

<p>Back to the story, even though the program officially started in Fall 2013, I actually
started working on my research right after we had our meeting. The first
sub-project was to run a literature review on the area of interest for
the PhD. This would give me a head-start in terms of positioning my
research a whole year before enrolling officially. And I thought, I&#8217;d
also get a feeling about enrolling into a PhD that&#8217;d help to &#8220;fail fast&#8221;,
essentially I could call it a &#8220;quit&#8221; if I didn&#8217;t like the work before
enrolling. Also, I switeched my job to join SourceFire, now part of
Cisco, because the traveling projects with ThoughtWorks weren&#8217;t working
for me anymore. I wanted to be with my wife, and international travels
were screwing up with my Canadian immigration and citizenship
requirements.</p>

<p>Life was still quite easy till the April of 2013. Then, we had our first
born and it changed upside down. I think like most other first time
parents, we had little idea about how much work it is to raise a little
child on your own without substantial family support. To make things a
little more challenging, the deadline for the first paper I wrote was
about two weeks after Shopoth was born. In that two week, we barely got
any sleep. But Shahana was adament, and let me take the time away to
complete the paper on time. It felt good to be able to submit the paper.
We both felt that it was doable.</p>

<p>Fast forward about a month. So, Shopoth is about 7 weeks old. My mother
had left after helping us with the first few weeks of Shopoth&#8217;s life. We
, the three of us, went for a walk for the first time around the beautiful tree-laden neighborhood of the
varsity community in Calgary. I recall precisely, it was a beautiful
early summer day. We just crossed a playground and turned left on a
corner. My phone beeped signaling an email notification about the paper
I submitted. It had this:</p>

<blockquote><p> We regret to inform you that your submission titled &#8230;has not been accepted&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>I felt sweaty, and wanted to keep it to myself. I could only do so for a
few hours, and then shared this with Shahana. She was still recovering
from the c-section, and was under a lot of stress due to the sudden
changes in her life. I remember, she was saying only positive things
about it and tried to encourage me to carry on.</p>

<p>As it happens, I moved on and decided to get into the PhD program
anyway. During this year, I also got quite a bit engaged with things at
the new job and started taking more responsibilities from a leadership
perspective. To complete the course requirements, I&#8217;d have to complete
at least three graduate courses, and transfer the credits from one of
the courses I did while doing my MBA before coming to Canada.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most people eventually come across a time when they&#8217;d need to provide
names of colleagues as references while applying for a new job. The
referees are often involved in the last stage of the hiring process,
when the employer is generally satisfied that the candidate is a
potential hire. At this stage, the employer expects to find a few
things:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Verification of facts.</strong> The employer wants to confirm the validity of
the information such as the role, responsibilities, and achievements
provided by the candidate about their past experience.</li>
<li><strong>Qualitative feedback.</strong> The employer wants to understand the &#8220;cultural
fitness&#8221; aspect of the candidate by asking questions related to the
individual&#8217;s interaction and collaboration skills.</li>
</ol>


<p>While these are valid goals, I personally find the practice of using
references to achieve these goals to be a rather flawed one. Here&#8217;s why:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>References aren&#8217;t replacements for interviews.</strong> As an employer,
the responsibility is on the employer to be smart enough to verify
that the skills and experiences as advertised by a candidate&#8217;s resume
reflect the reality. If the employer can&#8217;t do that with a reasonable
amount of confidence, they&#8217;re likely to hire wrong candidates anyway.</li>
<li><strong>Likely outdated.</strong> If a candidate is currently employed, due to the
secret nature of most job searches, they are unlikely to use one of
their coworkers as the referee. As a result, the longer a candidate
is employed by the most recent employer, the more outdated the
references tend to get.</li>
<li><strong>Likely tampered.</strong> If a candidate wants to use a referee, they&#8217;d
generally contact ahead of time with the referee. Even if they don&#8217;t
contact, the candidates are likely to mention names of people that
are almost certain to say good things about them. For any qualitative
feedback, this setup limits the possibility of getting any negative
traits of a candidate.</li>
<li><strong>Open to interpretation.</strong> Reference checks are often done over
phone. Also, the person calling to check the reference often hasn&#8217;t met the
candidate during the interview steps. This creates a double-blindness
of sort. So, anything said during the reference check process suffers
from possibilities of information gap.</li>
</ol>


<p> In my opinion, if reference checks are used, they should only be used
 to verify factual information. That too, should be done keeping in mind
 that the information may be outdated, or intentionally biased.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You didn&#8217;t go to college to study computer science and you have no
background on computer programming. You&#8217;re not quite happy with your
current job area, and looking forward to something more rewarding and
exciting. You&#8217;ve heard software development is generally a good area
and often times people without any prior software background can
actually get a job. But where do you start?</p>

<p>First, you&#8217;re thinking in the right direction, and I can assure you that
if you like making things and have a nack for problem-solving, you can
learn the skills to become a programmer. Now, let me share a path
forward from here:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Take an online course and learn a programming language</strong>. I&#8217;d
suggest learning the programming language Ruby, using the courses
offered by <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/learn/ruby">CodeSchool</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Build a demo application</strong>. Here&#8217;s an idea: Make an app for
tracking personal expenses so that you can enter all your expenses
and see reports about your expenses on a weekly / bi-weekly / monthly
basis by type of expense such as food, transportation, accommodation,
utility etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Publish the application to the internet</strong>. Use Heroku to pubish
your app to the internet and use it for yourself. When things don&#8217;t
work as expected, fix bugs or extend the application to better serve
your needs.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I&#8217;d say spend about <strong>6 months</strong> on the steps 1-3. Once you&#8217;ve an
application that you&#8217;re somewhat proud to show to your friends or
prospective employees, it&#8217;s a sign that you&#8217;re progessing. But don&#8217;t
apply for jobs just yet. I&#8217;d suggest spending another 6 months to learn
a few more fundamental programming topics:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Algorithms</strong>: Take an online course on basic algorithms to understand
the different types of algorithmic approaches that can be used to
solve known problems.</li>
<li><strong>Data structures</strong>: Take an online course on data structures since you&#8217;ll
need to use them on a daily basis and this is one of those topics
where it&#8217;ll be hard to learn on the job from no prior background.</li>
<li><strong>Object oriented concepts</strong>: Take an online course to understand the
fundamental concepts behind object oriented programming. It takes
years to master the concepts, but taking a course will greatly help you
to get the basics right.</li>
</ol>


<p>If you spent a year of your free time (8-10 hours a week), you&#8217;ve now
acquired the basics that will be required to find a job. Obviously, you
can squeeze it in a much smaller time window if you dedicate more time
and already have some background with math / computing skills. But at a
mimimum, I think it&#8217;ll take six months for most people to get there.</p>

<p>Now, I&#8217;d suggest you to take two bootcamps. The bootcamps are great in
two ways. First, you get to work with peers and immerse into building
something. Second, you can judge yourself against the peers to
understand where you stand against the pros and newbies. Take notes and
get ready for a second bootcamp. This time, the idea is to understand if
you&#8217;ve improved since the first bootcamp and able to perform better than
the first time.</p>

<p>After the bootcamps, if you&#8217;re feeling positive, it&#8217;s time to start
looking for jobs. Make sure to find a job that matches your skills and
keep an open mind about accepting a job that may not pay top dollars
yet. If you find a job, and you&#8217;ll, go ahead and take it. You&#8217;ll be
learnig at a fast pace on the job, and if you&#8217;re good, you&#8217;ll be
rewarded accordingly either on the current job or on a new job. The idea
is to focus on learning on the job, but also off the job to learn topics
that may not be of interest on the job.</p>

<p>If you followed this plan, I expect you to get your first job as a
programmer in 1.5-2 years, and get profecient in 4 years. Prepare
accordingly. May be the 4 years is worth when you consider you&#8217;ll be
happier and better rewarded for many more years to come.</p>

<time datetime="2017-02-27T15:42:00-08:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 27<span>th</span>, 2017</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>No matter which side of the table you&#8217;ve sat during interviews, you&#8217;ve
probably heard this question: <strong>&#8216;Why do you want this new job?&#8217;</strong></p>

<p>In the recent past, I&#8217;ve interviewed a few candidates and heard the
following answers so far:</p>

<ol>
<li>I&#8217;m not learning much on the current job after it&#8217;s been 2-4 years.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m looking for something that offers better work-life balance.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m not really looking for a job. The recruiters got in touch and I
thought I&#8217;d discuss.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m looking for more challenging work.</li>
</ol>


<p>All of the above are valid answers. I think there&#8217;s another perfectly
valid answer that candidates seldom mention probably due to the gravity
of the interview room situation. I&#8217;ve interviewed over a hundred
candidates across different companies and am yet to find anyone that
mentions: <strong>I am not happy with my current salary and benefits compared
to my skills</strong></p>

<p>Back to topic of answers. So, when someone answers that they are not
learning new things on the job, obviously, you&#8217;d be curios to know why
and how they have tried to change things. Unfortunately, most candidates
simply mention that they are doing repeat work and there&#8217;s not much to
learn doing the same thing over and over again. This is where I start
feeling a little uneasy. However, I understand that it&#8217;s a true
statement. If you&#8217;re in a similar situation, here&#8217;s some suggestion:
read books, and write code based on what you&#8217;ve read. Then, you can tell
a much convincing story that, I&#8217;ve forced myself to learn new things and
here&#8217;s some proof, but I really want to apply the newly learned skills
outside the scope of the &#8220;hello world&#8221; skills.</p>

<p>About work-life balance, I totally hear you. And if your current job
doesn&#8217;t suit what you need out of your life, it&#8217;s a perfectly valid
reason to look for new opportunities. However, make sure you&#8217;re able to
clearly set the expectation with your potential employer about what
work-life balance means for you. For example, if you can&#8217;t work over 40
hours a week, or must work from home one-two days a week, it&#8217;s best to
discuss this even before an interview starts to ensure you&#8217;re a good
match with the employer.</p>

<p>If you showed up at in interview just because a recruiter got in touch,
I&#8217;d say introspect first. It&#8217;s possible that on our subconcious mind you
have expectations that the potential of the new job offers you something
that you don&#8217;t get at the current job. So, instead of a passive asnwer
that the you simply acted based on the recruiter&#8217;s invite, it&#8217;s much
convincing to see if you can lay down one or two things that you expect
from the new job that you don&#8217;t get at the current job.</p>

<p>About looking for more challenge, it sounds like a cliche unless you can
share examples of work that is of challenging to you. May be you like
the challenge of using more complicated algorithms, may be you like
dealing with a lot of data, may be you like supporting production
emergencies, but there&#8217;s gotta be something that you can explicitly
mention as challenging. It helps employers to understand if they&#8217;re able
to provide you with enough challenge on the job.</p>

<p>Finally, if you&#8217;re looking for a new job because the current job isn&#8217;t
paying upto the level of your skills and contributions, make sure to
communicate it clearly as well. With salaries and benefits, I find it
much easier to work with people that know the actual $ figure that&#8217;ll
make them happy instead of beating around the bush to create confusions
all around. Just be confident and tell what makes you happy. If the
employer can afford it, most likely they&#8217;ll want to get you onboard as
a happy employee. If they can&#8217;t afford it, they&#8217;ll do their best. The
key here is to be explicit about what you want and be sure and confident
about it.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, when you walk into an interview it&#8217;s yours to lose. The
potential employer is investing their time and resources and would
rather have you hired than having to interview other candidates. As long
as you are able to justify why you want the new job, they&#8217;ll be quite
accommodating.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>2016 Highs and lows</h3>

<h4>Baby #2, it&#8217;s a girl</h4>

<p>Shera, our little daughter, was born this year. She has been happy, healthy, and an absolute source of joy. Almost hard to believe that we somehow sustained the pregnancy period of my wife, while also running after our active toddler son, Shopoth. Such a pleasure to see the two already reaching for one another, cuddling, giggling, and occasionally fighting.</p>

<h4>Canadian Citizenship, eh!</h4>

<p>I&#8217;m very glad and proud to be a Canadian citizen starting this year. I just realized that I spent 21% of my life in Canada already! For those of you that haven&#8217;t been to Canada yet, you should visit some time for it&#8217;s one of the most beautiful places on earth with people of good heart.</p>

<h4>Life &amp; Work, well balanced</h4>

<p>Mostly doing 40-hour work weeks and working from home once / week. The team I&#8217;m managing has built up on solid foundations now. This is super exciting to see motivated people working on challenging projects and consistently delivering quality outcome.</p>

<h4>Personal finances, thumbs-down</h4>

<p>While the return on my experimental investing portfolio has been great, I didn&#8217;t make good on the car-buying decision. Ended up getting into a 4-year lease on a car that has more seats than our living room, and we only really needed it for the summer while we had family with us.</p>

<h4>Health, got lazy</h4>

<p>Honestly, it was a tough year to dedicate time for health. I know you&#8217;re thinking &#8220;it&#8217;s a lame excuse.&#8221; On the bright side, our team won the friendly soccer tournament this summer, and played soccer almost each of the Friday nights starting October. However, I got lazy otherwise. Probably also just too tired from the kids and housework at times.</p>

<h4>Relationships, so-so</h4>

<p>Met some friends and had a few phone calls with friends throughout the year. But, I failed to connect with relatives outside my first family. This is likely a result of being so far physically, but also something that only gets worse unless actively taken care of.</p>

<h4>Remote work, didn&#8217;t work too well</h4>

<p>We spent the first month of 2016 in Bangladesh with family. It was my first time experiment working remotely with a 12 hour timezone difference. It was fun to start. But I could feel the stress of having to stay up till 2-3AM each night and dealing with Internet latency issues. While I had a decent accommodation and a makeshift office arrangement, it got harder to get enough sleep. Next time if I work remotely, I will limit my commitment to midnight.</p>

<h4>Misc. things</h4>

<ol>
<li>Continued our charity program financing to support education in Bangladesh.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t have any public speaking session in the whole year for the first time in past 10 years.</li>
<li>Ended up spending too much time on social media for little gain.</li>
<li>While made some progress towards my PhD thesis, didn&#8217;t submit any paper.</li>
</ol>


<p>There&#8217;s a 2nd post coming about the new year&#8217;s resolution. Come back in a few days.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have finally been able to attend a RailsConf, the 2015 edition was my first ever. And I got to say hi to people like @dhh, @wycats, and many more. Thanks Cisco for sponsoring this trip.</p>

<p>The attendance on the conference was totally amazing, heaven knows how many, but it looked like a couple thousands of rails developers attended the @dhh keynote. And @dhh delivered a good one. Unlike the last year&#8217;s talk, this year it didn&#8217;t cause a huge noise because it was mostly about announcing new features of rails to be released with Rails 5. However, some rails core committers took it to twitter to share their surprise when they heard about Action Cable for the first time at the keynote. But everyone kept it limited to some trolling!</p>

<p>The @tenderlove keynote was the one that I really liked of all the talks that I attended. He is expected to be funny, and in front of a hall full of rails developers, he indeed delivered a fun talk, mixed with some serious performance improvement techniques and amazing new feature announcements coming with Rails 5. I envy his presentation skills. He talked about performance testing bundler on a system with a hundred thousand gems. It was quite fascinating to see how he was able to improve a polynomial time algorithm into a constant time one to cut down bundler boot up time, essentially speeding up all rails and ruby applications. Great work.</p>

<p>Of course, the conference talks are made available on videos and are open for anyone to watch. However, attending a conference is more about meeting people on the hallways than about listening to their talks. At least to me, that&#8217;s what I want from a conference. For example, I met Chris, a guy that was working on a gem to wrap InfluxDB interface under an active record like abstraction. Thought that was cool. Met a guy named Charles, who works for a startup company writing software for automated airline landing. Met a guy named John, who writes his own online game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For an opinionated framework like Ruby on Rails, I expect it to come pre-bundled with a CoffeeScript based test framework and test runner. Here&#8217;s why:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Teams don&#8217;t need to waste time deciding which one to use among the mess of Jasmine, Mocha, Expect, Sinon, Chai, Bower, Grunt, Teaspoon, Npm&#8230; you name it.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;d work better than what&#8217;s out there since the Rails team will focus on clean integration with Rails and will have a much larger user base to collect contribution from.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;d prefer <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a> to be the test framework and a runner similar to <a href="https://github.com/modeset/teaspoon">teaspoon</a> that can run the specs both on the command line and on the browser, with asset pipelines enabled.</p>

<p>Rails made a huge promise to test automation by shipping with a nicely structured way to test the ruby code and doing the same for JS would make life better for so many people like me, I believe.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let&#8217;s face it, the manual process of documenting REST APIs sucks big time. The process goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Craft a cURL request for an API Endpoint.</li>
<li>Copy the response.</li>
<li>Narrate the API, paste the cURL and response on an editor.</li>
<li>Edit the response, describe necessary request and response headers, query parameters etc.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1-4 for each of your tens of Endpoints.</li>
<li>Publish the documentation on the web.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for each release.</li>
</ol>


<p>This is a laborious process. However, it doesn&#8217;t have to be this way. Meet <a href="http://SpyREST.com">SpyREST</a> to see how it produces purely <strong>organic</strong>, <strong>automated</strong>, <strong>replayable</strong>, <strong>published</strong>, <strong>version aware</strong> and <strong>customizable</strong> API Documentation for you.</p>

<p>This is how it works:</p>

<ol>
<li>You script the API calls using any scripting you prefer, including bash/cURL, automated test frameworks, etc. For example, using a test framework:</li>
</ol>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>describe 'gists' do
</span><span class='line'>  it "List a user's gists since a time:" do
</span><span class='line'>    response = Github.get '/users/smsohan/gists?since=20140101T00:00:00Z', @common_options
</span><span class='line'>    assert_equal 200, response.code
</span><span class='line'>    refute_nil response.body
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ol>
<li>Use the SpyREST http proxy <code>http://SpyREST.com:9081</code> to perform this call on a real API.</li>
<li>You get the same response, and SpyREST produces a fully baked API documentation as you see <a href="http://spyrest.com/api_actions/details?api_action=GET+%2Fusers%2Fsmsohan%2Fgists&amp;api_host=api.github.com&amp;api_resource=gists&amp;api_version=v3">here</a>:</li>
</ol>


<p>Try here if you want to see for yourself:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>curl -k -x "http://spyrest.com:9081" -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" "https://api.github.com/users/YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME/gists"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a much shorter new year post. 2014 was the year of focusing on health, soft-skills, Haskell, social contribution and PhD in addition to typical everyday stuff. Hoping 2015 will be the year of:</p>

<blockquote><p>reconnecting with friends and relatives</p>

<p>perfection</p></blockquote>

<p>While Facebook and Twitter make it easy to browse through my friends&#8217; photos and status updates, I feel quite reluctant to interact on these media. Also, this passive mode of keeping in touch sucks, since my friends are largely unaware of the fact that I still care. So, 2015 will be the year when I regularly call people, and talk to them on the phone/skype/in person.</p>

<p>Perfection. On most occasions I&#8217;m happy if something I tried yielded just enough. 2015, I&#8217;ll strive for perfection beyond just enough.</p>

<p>Wishing everyone a joyful 2015, Happy new year.</p>
