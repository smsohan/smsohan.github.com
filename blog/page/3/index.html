Design Thinking course, Cisco Calgary Office, AB, 2019
</small></p>

<p>One benefit of working at Cisco is access to the many learning and development resources. Our learning and development org arranges hundreds of courses throughout the year. Moreover, we have a reimbursement program for external courses, conferences, books, and subscriptions to online learning programs and publications.</p>

<p>In the past 6 years, I have immensely benefitted from these resources. Here&#8217;s a list of the learning resources I&#8217;ve used.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com">Safari books online</a>, aka O&#8217;Reilly learning: In the past 3 years, have taken 3 online trainings and 7 books on this platform so far.</li>
<li>Design thinking, 2019: A two-day course taught by consultants about how to apply the principles of design thinking to communicate and derive solutions to complex problems.</li>
<li>Mindfulness, 2019: A 5-week program taught by consultants, with one hour per week, where I learned about staying mindful and effective at work amid all the chaos that surrounds it.</li>
<li><a href="http://tufte.com">Tufte one-day course</a>, 2019: Attended a course taught by Edward Tufte on data visualization and learned about the principles that make compelling data visualization.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sans.org/course/hacker-techniques-exploits-incident-handling">SANS incident response</a>, 2018: A packed week-long program where I learned to think like a hacker by learning about and then hacking some interesting vulnerabilities in systems.</li>
<li><a href="https://dcloud-cms.cisco.com/demo_news/cisco-r00tcamp-lab-v1">Cisco R00tcamp</a>, 2017: A packed week-long program where I learned hands-on pen-testing techniques to build more secure software.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/threat-hunting-workshop.html">Cisco threat-hunting</a>, 2017: A daylong course to find root case that triggered a security threat using integrated Cisco tools, including the product I build with our team.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.railsconf.com/2015/">RailsConf</a>, 2015: It was a big opportunity to meet the community and bring some of their practices in-house. For example, we started using <a href="https://www.bugsnag.com">BugSnag</a> after learning about it in the conference.</li>

</sub></p>

<p>This weekend I went to <a href="https://polyglotyyc.ca">Polyglot YYC 2019</a>.
It&#8217;s a gathering of tech people from around Calgary. The event was open
to all possible topics, hence the name Polyglot.
It was the first unconference style meetup I went to and this post
is a summary of my day.</p>

<p>About the attendees, I don&#8217;t have the official count, but I imagine there were
close to a hundred people. Quite a few
people represented the sponsor companies. The sponsors
advertised for hiring new employees, mostly software engineers. On the
other hand, I met a few people who joined this venue to talk to prospective employers.
Some of the attendees were enrolled in a coding bootcamp to switch
careers. I was quite happy to see the community praising their enthusiasm towards the bootcampers.
Moreover, I met a few regular tech meetup people after a long time. I used to go to
all tech meetups I could find in town before having kids, and I felt
great to be among the self-motivated crowd after a long break.</p>

<p>About the event, I was fascinated by how the unconference took its shape.
At check-in time, everyone got a couple of forms to write down topics
of interest, either as a host or a participant. Everyone could vote for five
such topics. I didn&#8217;t prepare
beforehand. So, I put up a topic that I&#8217;m presently curios about, &#8220;Writing for Developers&#8221;.
A handful of people voted for me, but it didn&#8217;t make the cut. I found
some ideas better than mine and was happy that those got
voted to the top. In hindsight, I should&#8217;ve proposed the topic of &#8220;Why
Are You Not Innovating?&#8221;. I did an internal presentation on this topic
at Cisco and it was generally praised by my colleagues.</p>

<p>My other observation is, between technical and soft-skill related
topics, I liked the soft-skill ones better. For example, I found the topics on hiring,
choosing a technical vs. managerial career path to be more interesting than
the topics such as GraphQL and ReactJS. A few years ago, I&#8217;d
just choose the technical topics without thinking twice. This is also a
pattern in my recent blog posts or reading list.</p>

<p>In the hiring session, I saw a positive attitude towards hiring remotes
and treating them as equals. This is a major mindset shift among the
community.</p>

<p>In the individual contributor vs. management career path session, the
attendee list included both kinds as well as people that had transitioned in either
direction. The one take home message I got from this session was, when
confused with career choice, individual contributors and managers should take the step to
switch roles. And if things don&#8217;t work out, it&#8217;s totally possible
to revert later.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to the 2020 edition of this event and may even prepare to
come up with a good idea for the unconference. If you can, please
join us for the next round.</p>

Showing a Screenshot of Microsoft Word for Mac and Apple Pages</p>

<p>This is what you get by default when you open a blank document on both editors.
I love that Apple Pages puts a deep focus on the content. If you haven&#8217;t used it, I&#8217;d
recommend trying it out. I know Microsoft Word has a known face, so
you&#8217;re likely used to all the distractions that sorrounds the content.
But, if you can, give Apple Pages a try.</p>

<p>Whenever faced with a production issue, I find exceptions to be an extremely useful
information source. A careful look at an
exeption has often led to quick discovery
of the source of a trouble. On the flip side, I have also
faced a lot of chaotic debugging sessions because of poor exception handling.
Here, I present the common anti-patterns that I recommend fixing while
reviewing pull-requests. Most programmers are already familiar with the mechanics of exception
handling. Yet, I see these anti-patterns everyday.</p>

<p>I primarily see these anti-patterns to be control-flow or logging related as shown below:</p>

<h2>Control-flow Anti-patterns</h2>

<p><strong>Unhandled.</strong> When an exception is unhandled, if often results in a
clueless user experience for the end user as well as the developer.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">notify</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">email!</span> <span class="c1">#May fail due to configuration, network, or authentication</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>Catch-all.</strong> With catch-all errors, it&#8217;s often difficult to quickly detect the
original problem. For the same reason, the end users don&#8217;t get specific
and actionable error messages.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">create</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">save!</span> <span class="c1">#May fail due to database issues</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">rescue</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">error</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1"># handle</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>If-else Exceptions.</strong> Exceptions mean something unexpected took
place. If-else is used for logical known code paths. For example, when
accepting an API request, invalid input data is often a known logical
path. Using exceptions for it will trigger false alarms.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>Wrapped Exception.</strong> A new exception is raised hiding the original exception. In such cases,
if the exception is handled by the caller, <strong>critical context information
is lost</strong> since the orignal stacktrace is no longer available.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">create</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">save!</span> <span class="c1">#May fail due to database issues</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>Useless Custom Exception.</strong> Introducing a new exception type when a pre-defined exception suits just
fine.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1">#...</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>Leaky Handler.</strong> Handling an error without cleaning system resources such as file
handles, open network connections, can cause cascading system outage.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<h2>Logging Anti-Patterns</h2>

<p><strong>Silent Handler.</strong> Makes it very difficult to debug problems.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">create</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">save!</span> <span class="c1">#May fail due to database issues</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">rescue</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>Debug-only Handler.</strong> Similar to silent handler since most production apps run in non-debug
log level.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">log</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">debug</span> <span class="s2">&quot;failed to save post </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">error</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">message</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">error</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">backtrace</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>Custom Message-only Handler.</strong> Some exception handlers only log a custom
message leaving the details of the exceptions. As a result, critical
information is lost that can be very useful for debugging.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">create</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">save!</span> <span class="c1">#May fail due to database issues</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">rescue</span> <span class="no">SaveError</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">log</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">warn</span> <span class="s2">&quot;failed to save post&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>Message-only Handler.</strong> Without Stacktrace, it gets very difficult to trace the root of a
problem since often times exception handlers wrap a few lines of code.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<p>There are times when you intentionally have to use some of these
anti-patterns. But those are rare. It&#8217;s critical for the developers to
think about the information that&#8217;d help in swiftly debugging a production problem. As such,
developers must avoid the noise and provide all context information for
errors to help diagnose potential system problems.</p>

<p>Happy coding.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After being a people leader at work for the past six years, I’m now going through a phase of introspection. Essentially, I’m trying to understand my own philosophy about people leadership so that I can clearly communicate it to the people that I support.</p>

<p>My most important realization is, <strong>people leadership is all about developing people</strong>. What I mean by this is, for everyone I’m supporting, I must carefully build a plan that provides them with the opportunities to stay motivated so that they can thrive. With this goal, once I wrote down my understanding of what motivates each of the people I support, it was quite eye opening to see the differences among people. Going through this process, I also realized how unprepared I was in terms of providing them with a clear career path to achieve their best.</p>

<p>If you’re interested, I’ve shared a template of the <strong>people development document</strong> here.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Name: ___
</span><span class='line'>Date:___
</span><span class='line'>Current role: ___
</span><span class='line'>Motivation: ___
</span><span class='line'>Upcoming opportunity in the next three months:___
</span><span class='line'>Upcoming opportunity in the next year:___</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I consider this to be a living document as people often develop new interests and the opportunities at work change with time. But keeping a clear log of each individual’s career is a great way to establish and manage expectations. You can build this with the the individuals directly and update it when you meet for one-on-one feedbacks. As a lead, when you collaboratively build this, you empower them and build a trusting relationship as you both see how the motivations align with the work.</p>

<p>From the past 13 years of my time in the industry, working for 5 different companies, personally I’ve always felt a little under-informed about how my leaders planned a career development for me. Through my introspection of being a people leader, I realized I didn’t honestly appreciate the need for such clarity among the people I supported. So, I wanted to change it. And found the written document to be a simple yet surprisingly powerful tool to fill this void.</p>

<p>Now, if you’re a people leader, I’d recommend doing this exercise with your people. You’ll be pleasantly surprised by the outcome.</p>

<p>If you aren’t a people leader, you can write it down for yourself and ask your leader to collaborate on it. This way, when you have a one-on-one, you both will have the same reference document to focus on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, we had a production outage for a few minutes due a database
migration on one of our Ruby on Rails apps. The deployment went fine
through a few
stages, but the problem only showed up at the last and the largest
stage. This is exactly what happened during the deploy process.</p>

<ol>
<li>New code was deployed. Restart was pending, so the server was still
running old code.</li>
<li>Migrations ran.</li>
<li>One migration removed a column that was used in the old code, but no
longer used in the new code.</li>
<li>The next migration was a data migration that inserted one row / user
to a table. This was a very slow migration, taking 5+ minutes.</li>
<li>The old code failed because it tried to use a column in the database
that was no longer there. To make things worse, the column was
referenced at all page loads within the app.</li>
<li>The long running migration didn&#8217;t finish because it ran into a
timeout.</li>
<li>The servers weren&#8217;t restarted because the migration had failed. So,
the new code wasn&#8217;t served at all.</li>
<li>There was no automatic database rollback to restore the system into a good
state with the old code.</li>
</ol>


<p>The team was able to resolve the issues within the next 5 minutes, but
it was the worst system outage we&#8217;ve seen in years. For anyone dealing
with a large Ruby on Rails app, you can use the following
safeguards to avoid such problems:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Do not remove a column from the database while the current code is
still using it. Do it at a later release.</strong></li>
<li>When a deployment fails at the migration step, ensure you have a
rollback policy so that the system can be automatically restored to a
known good state.</li>
<li>Consider data migrations to be a performance problem and always test
the migrations with relaistic load before production release.</li>
<li>If possible, run your data migrations seprately from schema
migrations so that you don&#8217;t incur deployment delays for optional new
data.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote><p>Most problems are solved inefficiently. Innovation follows when a problem is researched first.</p></blockquote>

<p>I spent a fair amount of time in grad school. First, sixteen months on my MSc, and then another forty eight months on my PhD program. Also, I worked as a pro software engineer for 20 hours/week during my MSc days and then full-time during the PhD days. It was quite an undertaking, but I survived and now claiming my bragging rights :-)</p>

<p>This post is about a general problem-solving approach that I internalized as the most valuable lesson from my grad school days. I hope you find it useful.
I&#8217;ll try and explain the concept using a personal story. Here you go.</p>

<p>Recently, I was discussing plans for the near future with my wife, Shahana. She&#8217;s an engineer. In the past, Shahana worked in the telecom industry as a network planner for a few years. Then, she decided to take an extended maternity leave to stay with our two little kids, Shopoth and Shera. Now, honestly, she&#8217;s had enough and seriously contemplating a return to work. Except, she&#8217;s unsure about what career to choose that she&#8217;d really enjoy.</p>

<p>Given this vague problem of finding a new career, she felt lost for a while. As a true supportive husband, I decided to be her man and gave her an earful!</p>

<p>Silly jokes apart, we decided to set the <strong>context</strong> first by asking and answering the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Why</strong> is she looking for a new career?</li>
<li><strong>Why not</strong> remain in the old career?</li>
<li><strong>What</strong> new career options exist?</li>
<li><strong>Where</strong> are the opportunities?</li>
<li><strong>Who</strong> knows more about those?</li>
<li><strong>How</strong> does she get a job in the preferred area?</li>
</ol>


<p>After spending a few days of research, she developed a very clear <strong>understanding of the problem</strong> and the initial vagueness of the situation was mostly wiped clean resulting in a few clear <strong>constraints</strong>. From a job portal, Shahana then <strong>listed available</strong> job requirements from a number of open positions matching her criteria. After consolidation of the requirements, the <strong>gap</strong> was clear. It was obvious that she&#8217;d need to <strong>develop essential new</strong> skills to qualify for the jobs. As she acquires the new skills, she already knows the <strong>evaluation</strong>. If this doesn&#8217;t work, she can <strong>repeat</strong> the same process to either <strong>improve</strong> her chances or choose an <strong>alternate</strong> career path entirely.</p>

<p>This was a direct application of the problem-solving framework that I learned from grad school. Here&#8217;s a nerdy version of the framework:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>  Given a problem
</span><span class='line'>    1. Ask the Wh questions -&gt; list constraints
</span><span class='line'>    2. Research -&gt; list existing solutions
</span><span class='line'>    3. Is the problem already solved? -&gt; If yes, stop
</span><span class='line'>    4. Innovate, fill in the gaps.
</span><span class='line'>    5. Evaluate</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In real life, most problems are deceptive. We think we already know the best solution based on our past experience and go straight to #4 leaving all other parts out. Even if going straight to #4 is actually a wise move, it only becomes an innovation with a tiny impact, as it doesn&#8217;t become available at step 3 for others to leverage.</p>

<p>A large number of problems can be solved at step 3, by leveraging a solution or a mix of multiple solutions that already exist. Even when problems get past step 3, it&#8217;s highly likely that the gap is smaller than the extent of the whole problem. So, an innovation can focus only on solving the gap, which offers speed and intelligent reuse.</p>

<p>This post is so prosaic already. But if you&#8217;re still with me, I&#8217;ll make it even more textbook like by giving you a couple of practice problems. Go ahead and apply my 5-step problem solving approach:</p>

<ol>
<li>Jane is a musician, a prodigy so to speak. She&#8217;s been invited to talk about music as a therapy. She&#8217;s not good at speaking, but this is a big opportunity. What does she do?</li>
<li>Mike is a young startup CEO. He&#8217;s very good at business and technology. He needs a lawyer to take care of the legal matters. How does he hire the best lawyer possible?</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Past few months at work we&#8217;re trying to revamp our CI infra. This has
been a migration from a <a href="https://jenkins.io">Jenkins</a> cluster to <a href="https://www.gocd.org">GoCD</a>.
This post is a result of my frustrations with the state of CI in the age of Git/GitHub.</p>

<p>With Pull Requests, or a form of pre-merge review process, it&#8217;s common
to leverage a few automated checks alongside our human peers to remove
potentially breaking changes from being merged into the repo. These
changes typically require a CI server and often multiple CI
jobs/pipelines to check test run / coverage results, linting, or any other policy
that can be automatically enforced.</p>

<p>This is where you need to integrate your GitHub/what have you with your
GoCD or the likes. And it&#8217;s a time consuming task for any complicated
project. You essentially, setup pipelines that are somewhat duplicate
to be executed pre and post merge. The more I think about, the more it
feels like the whole CI process should be a headless one, and deeply
embedded within the code repo. This would save unneccessary hassles such
as setting up user accounts / notifications across multiple systems,
navigating between web interfaces to see important logs when things
fail etc.</p>

<p>I like the direction <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/features/gitlab-ci-cd/">GitLab</a> is taking.
They have made CI part of GitLab UI so you can see the code and its
build status in the same place. I&#8217;d like other CI environments to do the
same, or at least be a little app/plugin that you can add on top of GitHub - to
blend within the GitHub experience such that it doesn&#8217;t feel like a
foreign object.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Finally, I defended my PhD thesis yesterday. Family, friends, and
colleagues are all sending their wishes, and it feels great to have
crossed this milestone.</p>

<p>To be honest, deep inside, I carry a sad and guilty feeling, which at
times overshadows the feeling of acomplishment. This phenomenon is hard
to write about, but I wanted to give it a try anyway.</p>

<p>So, it was 2012. Life was good. I got promoted to Senior Consultant at
ThoughtWorks and Shahana got a job almost immediately following the
completion of her grad school. We spent an amazing vacation to end the
year 2011, and the summer of 2012 was full of weekend trips to all the
beautiful touristy places. That summer we also found that we were gonna
be first time parents. It was an exciting time.</p>

<p>Along came fall. It started getting cold and wintery in Calgary. Both of
us would be home by 5:30 PM, and would look for things to do to keep
busy till bed time, which is about midnight. With slippery and often
icy sidewalk, going for walks oudoors would mean a serious risk for the
soon-to-be mom. So, we mostly stayed indoors. We were naive, and didn&#8217;t
quite learn to enjoy the serenity of the &#8220;nothing to do&#8221; time. So, in
one of such evenings, out of sheer boredom, I decided to shoot an email
to my then ex-supervisor asking if he could meet to discuss potentially
a part-time PhD admission for me.</p>

<p>He wrote back and we meet next week. He was quick to accept that request
and also ensured that he&#8217;d be able to pay my tuition and expences as a
scholarship, if required, for the full four years. I discussed this with
Shahana and we decided to take this opportunity. Officially, the program
would start in Fall 2013, about 5 months after the due date of our
first born.</p>

<p>This is going to be a long read. But I&#8217;m writing it while it&#8217;s fresh in
my memory from this overwhelmingly emotional time that I&#8217;m going through
since the exam yesterday. This write up is an attempt to dump the
different incidents that are showing up like storms in my mind at this
time. I think it&#8217;s written for myself, more than anything. But I
appologize if you&#8217;re reading this, since it&#8217;s a long format story, the
format that most people don&#8217;t like to read online.</p>

<p>Back to the story, even though the program officially started in Fall 2013, I actually
started working on my research right after we had our meeting. The first
sub-project was to run a literature review on the area of interest for
the PhD. This would give me a head-start in terms of positioning my
research a whole year before enrolling officially. And I thought, I&#8217;d
also get a feeling about enrolling into a PhD that&#8217;d help to &#8220;fail fast&#8221;,
essentially I could call it a &#8220;quit&#8221; if I didn&#8217;t like the work before
enrolling. Also, I switeched my job to join SourceFire, now part of
Cisco, because the traveling projects with ThoughtWorks weren&#8217;t working
for me anymore. I wanted to be with my wife, and international travels
were screwing up with my Canadian immigration and citizenship
requirements.</p>

<p>Life was still quite easy till the April of 2013. Then, we had our first
born and it changed upside down. I think like most other first time
parents, we had little idea about how much work it is to raise a little
child on your own without substantial family support. To make things a
little more challenging, the deadline for the first paper I wrote was
about two weeks after Shopoth was born. In that two week, we barely got
any sleep. But Shahana was adament, and let me take the time away to
complete the paper on time. It felt good to be able to submit the paper.
We both felt that it was doable.</p>

<p>Fast forward about a month. So, Shopoth is about 7 weeks old. My mother
had left after helping us with the first few weeks of Shopoth&#8217;s life. We
, the three of us, went for a walk for the first time around the beautiful tree-laden neighborhood of the
varsity community in Calgary. I recall precisely, it was a beautiful
early summer day. We just crossed a playground and turned left on a
corner. My phone beeped signaling an email notification about the paper
I submitted. It had this:</p>

<blockquote><p> We regret to inform you that your submission titled &#8230;has not been accepted&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>I felt sweaty, and wanted to keep it to myself. I could only do so for a
few hours, and then shared this with Shahana. She was still recovering
from the c-section, and was under a lot of stress due to the sudden
changes in her life. I remember, she was saying only positive things
about it and tried to encourage me to carry on.</p>

<p>As it happens, I moved on and decided to get into the PhD program
anyway. During this year, I also got quite a bit engaged with things at
the new job and started taking more responsibilities from a leadership
perspective. To complete the course requirements, I&#8217;d have to complete
at least three graduate courses, and transfer the credits from one of
the courses I did while doing my MBA before coming to Canada.</p>
