Sure, the constructors are methods too.. but they should not do anything more except internal initialization.<br /><br />I had a little habbit to put additional logic inside constructor, to be possible to write something like<br /><br />= new DoSomethingClass(x, y);<br /><br />I&#39;m getting rid of that also because of bad testability. Instead of that I write now:<br /><br />var smth = new DoSomethingClass(x, y);<br />smth.DoIt();</div>

I went with them, because at that time, I didn&#8217;t know of another renowned provider. But they have always been the best of producing the most confusing ever user interface. The account status email is one step ahead in that same direction.<br /><br />This is how it starts:<br /><br />At the top right corner, it says July 2011, in grayed out font! A deliberate attempt to de-emphasize the statement period!<br /><br />Just below the date, there is a fake input box and a button labeled Go. This is an image and if you click it, it will actually open a new page instead of asking for user input right inside the search box. This is just following the theory of most surprise (as opposed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">principle of least surprise</a>)!<br /><br />Next, in red background, they welcome me by saying, Welcome, S. M. Sohan! Customer Number: ### wtf? Customer Number? Do I give a shit what my customer number is? Why is the welcome grouped together with search and contact? How are these related?<br /><br />Then it says, Log in to your account on <b>our secure website</b> to view <b>your most recent account</b> statement. What does this mean? Does it mean, this statement is not recent? Is this not secure?<br /><br />Then it says, Summary of your account as of 7/21/2011<b>**</b>. That f&#8217;ing footnote will tell you that, the information may not reflect recent changes! What? Is this good enough till 7/21? If not, why do you even send this bullshit to me?<br /><br />Then it has 4 boxes side by side. The first one, <b>Messages</b> has Alerts: No, Notification(s): Yes. <b>View now</b> is a button to their site. How stupid is this? Why bother saying alerts &#8220;No&#8221;? If you know I have notifications, why not put it right here? Why are you confused about notification&#8221;(s)&#8221; - you should know if its just one (notification) or more (notifications). How lazy is that?<br /><br />Items Expiring is the other funny one. It says, Domain names: No. Then it says renew now. What? You&#8217;re saying nothing is expiring. Why on earth I would renew something?<br /><br />Then it takes almost 50% of the screen for asking me to contact with them through a number of channels including Facebook. Really? Facebook fan of GoDaddy? Crazy people!<br /><br />In the end, they don&#8217;t care putting a note of thanks, let alone personalize it with the name of an actual person. Isn&#8217;t it rude to end an email this way?<br /><br />Now, with all these hammerings - as if it fell short of creating enough fun, it says, More for You: followed by tens of fine print links to things that don&#8217;t matter at all to me. Oh boy! you are awesome!<br /><br />I am not a designer by any means. However, I think, even I can design a better version than this crap. Here&#8217;s my version in a screen mockup.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-T-ySiJT4c-s/TinOUi2YfRI/AAAAAAAAAV0/zXKeZxR2wIM/s1600/Screenshot-2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="330" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-T-ySiJT4c-s/TinOUi2YfRI/AAAAAAAAAV0/zXKeZxR2wIM/s400/Screenshot-2.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div>

Any kind of configuration file, be it an ugly xml file or a prettier yml or properties file, its been a source of frustration to me. Here&#8217;s a list of few such pain points:<br /><br /><ol><li>There are two config keys that point to the same value. e.g. db_username=master, data_source_user=master</li><li>There are two config keys for urls that point to the same domain, but different paths. e.g. market.com/cameras and market.com/undies</li><li>Config entries with placeholders. e.g. weather_url= weather.com/%s or weather_url= weather.com/%s/hourly</li><li>Config entries with default values that should not default to anything.</li><li>Config entries that are required but don&#8217;t fail the application deployment when not set.</li></ol><br />Are you having to deal with similar pain points? Some more?</div>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Code review, as any other review process, can often be an attack on someone&#8217;s ego and incite anger and frustration. Being both on sending and receiving end of such code reviews for years, I have learned a few how-not-to-do-it, or as one might say, anti-patterns of providing code review feedback. Let me know if you agree/disagree with me on the following:<br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>You are always reviewing Adam&#8217;s code while Adam is never reviewing yours.</li><li>Your feedback is like &#8220;Adam, <b>you should</b> break down part of this method into a private method&#8221; instead of &#8221;<b>we can probably</b> extract a part of&#8230;&#8221;</li><li>You are always suggesting, for example &#8221;<b>we should do</b> x and y and z&#8221;, instead of asking interesting questions &#8221;<b>can we</b> do x? <b>what if</b> we did y?&#8221; </li></ul></div></div>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br />Too often I see I am using a REST/SOAP API to talk to a third party system that frustrates me because of poor error messaging. Here&#8217;s an example to illustrate a typical frustration:<br /><br />Call: city_service.update_residence_address(city_dueler, new_address)<br />Response: &lt;status&gt;Failed&lt;/status&gt;&lt;error&gt;Invalid address&lt;/error&gt;<br /><br />But the address just seems right to me. So, I need to know specific reason about why the address is wrong. The error message leaves this critical detail. What happens next is, I look for the log files created by the city_service, conceptually supposed to be a third party hosted service. To do this, I SSH to the server, then cd to the logs folder and get lost in many of the cryptic log files. Then eventually I find a log and if I am lucky, I find something like the following:<br /><br />InvalidAddressException at:&#8230;<br />&#8230;<br />Street number is not listed..<br />&#8230;<br /><br />Now, I know I had an issue with the streer number. But I can see this only after I looked into the log of the thirdparty server. In an ideal case, I don&#8217;t have an access to their server. Even if I have it, I cannot easily understand their logs and stack traces! In most API calls to third party applications I have had this&nbsp;frustration&nbsp;to varying degrees.<br /><br /><b>Here&#8217;s a lesson learned:</b><br />Next time you expose an API for another app, expose error messages as specific as possible - so that, no details is left buried into your log files.</div></div>

Traditionally the .NET community, or more appropriately the users of .NET framework relied on products from Microsoft - so, in a product stack you are likely to see almost everything coming from Microsoft. However, some community contribution made its way into the main stream - for example, NUnit or Log4Net. But you can literally count the number of such main stream non-Microsoft products in your development stacks with your fingers (sparing a few)!<br /><blockquote>NuGet makes it easy to share your reusable library/utility code to the community. So, if you&#8217;ve done something cool that you wanna share, you should utilize the platform.</blockquote>One important difference between your and Microsoft&#8217;s contribution is, whatever you are contributing is likely to be a piece of software extracted from one of your real world projects. On the other hand, Microsoft attempts to produce something based on public interest and their imagination - often missing the real pain that you or I have. So, this mismatch between the designer and the actual consumer of the product often leaves a lot of opportunity for you. If you did something to solve your own pain on a project, its likely you&#8217;re not alone. So, share it with us.<br /><blockquote>NuGet official feed and website is a great place to get feedback.</blockquote>Did something cool? Well, you should feel good as people will use and appreciate your work. More importantly, they will provide you with interesting ideas and reviews that you haven&#8217;t thought about. Does this sound useful to you? People will go even further - they will directly contribute to the project with code!<br /><blockquote>NuGet will challenge you with competition from other contributors.</blockquote>A healthy competition is a great way of learning from others too. You&#8217;ll see other contributors attacking the same pain you are solving in a different approach, often directly challenging you! You love challenge, don&#8217;t you?<br /><blockquote>If you need hard numbers to get motivated, here&#8217;s some data from my MvcMailer project:<ul><li>Downloaded 600+ times in less than 2 months.</li></ul><ul><li>Received 60+ emails from people using MvcMailer, mostly encouraging feedback.</li></ul><ul><li>300%+ increase in my blog traffic.</li></ul></blockquote><br /><div>Bottom line is, you should publish your NuGet package if there&#8217;s any cool project you have done. Or, look out for what others are doing and possibly contribute with your code/suggestions. If you need an idea, look for StackOverflow questions, you&#8217;ll see there are solvable problems that people are fighting against time and again.</div></div>

For me, 2011 Q1 has so far been a good exposure to new techniques, tools, articles and books, thanks to ThoughtWorks book allowance! However, if you are interested, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s keeping me busy:<br /><ol><li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: large;">User Experience:</span> I find a good user experience is THE thing that you want in anything you design, and if you are writing a software, its even more important. After I read a few books, I have a feeling that its not just a common sense approach, it takes some education and a deep care to produce something usable. Check out my reading list at <a href="http://smsohan.com/">http://smsohan.com</a></li><li><span style="color: #274e13; font-size: large;">HTML5</span><span style="color: #274e13;">:</span> HTML5 is so more than just knowing How To Meet Ladies (HTML)! The popular browsers are all way ahead of the official HTML5 release date, so if you are building something on the web, its time you give it a real shot. Again, I shared my reading list on my website.</li><li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: large;">.NET NuGet</span><span style="color: #38761d;">: </span>Microsoft .NET just got a major component, NuGet package manager, that greatly simplifies the sharing and consuming of reusable libraries. Already there are tens of thousands of downloads for the popular .NET libraries and I believe its just a start. So, if you&#8217;ve done something cool in your project and want that to share with the .NET crowd, you should consider NuGet as a distribution channel and get some traction on it.</li><li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: large;">MvcMailer</span><span style="color: #38761d;">:</span> MvcMailer has got all my developer attention in the recent past. If you haven&#8217;t checked already, I highly encourage you take a look at its features <a href="https://github.com/smsohan/MvcMailer/wiki/MvcMailer-Step-by-Step-Guide">at this page</a> and you&#8217;ll see its a full stack elegant emailing solution that you need in your ASP.NET MVC projects. However, while working on this, I got familiar with the internals of the ASP.NET MVC source code and I consider this as a good experience.<span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></li><li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: large;">Functional Programming</span><span style="color: #38761d;">:</span> Did you learn one? Which one? Please suggest me your favorite functional language. In the remaining of this Q1, I want to spend some time on a functional programming language, probably F#.</li></ol>Its inspiring to see Calgary getting warmer these days - hope we get some outdoor soccer by the end of 2011 Q1, that would be awesome!</div>

Thanks for sharing the link. I started reading the online book at http://www.ctocorner.com/fsharp/book/<br />I like the approach in this book as it goes easy on the functional stuff for someone like me whose brain is prefilled will OO stuff!</div>

I&#39;m also going to learn F#.. But I would like to start with fundamentals, istead of language itself. <br /><br />I&#39;m considering this book to start:<br /><br />http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html<br /><br />Its availble in pdf, as well :)</div>

Thanks to 365+ downloads of the MvcMailer NuGet before it hit version 1.0 and now its time to wrap up the NuGet package for an official first release. I got several encouraging feedback on this package and here&#8217;s what you get from this first release:<br /><ol><li>Use Scaffold Mailer to generate your mailers with views. </li><li>Compose rich emails using your favorite ASP.NET MVC view engine.</li><li>Use master pages and pass data using ViewData/ViewBag.</li><li>Send multi-part emails for both text and html email readers.</li><li>Put images inline so that they are visible even when email client is offline.</li><li>Write unit test for your mailers and controllers that use the mailers.</li><li>Send attachments.</li><li>Send emails asynchronously.</li></ol>To my knowledge, MvcMailer is gonna be the first full stack ActionMailer like Emailing library for ASP.NET MVC 3. If you are an ASP.Net MVC programmer who deeply care about high quality work and maximizing efficiency - you gotta try MvcMailer 1.0 for writing pretty email sending code.<br />The <a href="https://github.com/smsohan/MvcMailer/wiki/MvcMailer-Step-by-Step-Guide">github wiki page</a> has everything you will need to know about MvcMailer. Version 1.0 comes out on Monday. Stay tuned.</div>

I didn&#8217;t even notice this little trick! As long as I didn&#8217;t have to call deliver_welcome_message (or deliver_*) methods that would magically call welcome_message, I was happy that now the magic is gone. Things are transparent!<br />Here&#8217;s an example showing the change: Say you have the following mailer:<br /><pre class="ruby">class Notifier &lt; ActionMailer::Base<br />  def welcome_message(new_user)<br />    #a warm welcome message<br />  end<br />end</pre>Now, prior to Rails 3, or ActionMailer 3, you would write the following to actually call this method to get the benefits of ActionMailer magics, such as finding the view based on method name and so on:<br /><pre class="ruby">Notifier.deliver_welcome_message(new_user_instance)  </pre>I am sure this deliver_* was a clever design decision to solve a hard problem, that is, finding the view name based on the method name. However, in ActionMailer 3, this is gone. Now the question is, if this trick is gone, how come it still finds the view name from the method name? Who sets the view name? To know the answer, first, let&#8217;s take a look at how we call the welcome_message now.<br /><pre class="ruby">Notifier.welcome_message(new_user_instance).send</pre><pre class="ruby">Instead of</pre><br /><pre class="ruby" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Notifier.<b>new</b>.welcome_message(new_user_instance).send</pre><br />So, the magic deliver_ prefix is gone. But, did you see the new trick? Well, its a clever design again. The trick this time is, you call your instance method, welcome_message as if it was a class method. But there is no class method called welcome_message, so it instead goes to method_missing and thats how it sets up the view name from this call. Here&#8217;s the code that does this little trick!<br /><pre class="ruby">def method_missing(method, *args) #:nodoc:<br />    return super unless respond_to?(method)<br />    new(method, *args).message<br />  end</pre>All it does is, instantiates the mailer with the method name!<br /><br />However, this design decision has interesting side effects as well. Or may be not side effects, but rather core effects. For example, since you are calling your mailer methods as class methods, you cannot use a single mailer instance to send out multiple emails at the same time. In fact, every mailer has only one instance of message. So, it cannot store two messages at the same time. This is as if, you can have multiple methods in a class, but you cannot call more than one class or you will mess up the class&#8217;s state!<br /><br />Wonder why? Well, this is rooted in another key design choice: ActionMailer::Base is a subclass of AbstractController::Base. Now, if you look at controllers, you will notice that at any given point of time, a controller instance is only responsible for responding to a single action. This is logical for controllers. But how about mailers? I see a mismatch in my mental model and the actual implementation model. I don&#8217;t see a reason why a mailer is a controller! For the sake of code reuse? But that could be done via delegation anyway.<br /><br />I will end this post with one question: <br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #073763;">Do you think mailer is a controller?</span></b> hints: think about LSP.</div>
