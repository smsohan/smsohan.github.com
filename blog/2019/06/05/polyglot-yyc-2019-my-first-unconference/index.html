<p>This weekend I went to <a href="https://polyglotyyc.ca">Polyglot YYC 2019</a>.
It&#8217;s a gathering of tech people from around Calgary. The event was open
to all possible topics, hence the name Polyglot.
It was the first unconference style meetup I went to and this post
is a summary of my day.</p>

<p>About the attendees, I don&#8217;t have the official count, but I imagine there were
close to a hundred people. Quite a few
people represented the sponsor companies. The sponsors
advertised for hiring new employees, mostly software engineers. On the
other hand, I met a few people who joined this venue to talk to prospective employers.
Some of the attendees were enrolled in a coding bootcamp to switch
careers. I was quite happy to see the community praising their enthusiasm towards the bootcampers.
Moreover, I met a few regular tech meetup people after a long time. I used to go to
all tech meetups I could find in town before having kids, and I felt
great to be among the self-motivated crowd after a long break.</p>

<p>About the event, I was fascinated by how the unconference took its shape.
At check-in time, everyone got a couple of forms to write down topics
of interest, either as a host or a participant. Everyone could vote for five
such topics. I didn&#8217;t prepare
beforehand. So, I put up a topic that I&#8217;m presently curios about, &#8220;Writing for Developers&#8221;.
A handful of people voted for me, but it didn&#8217;t make the cut. I found
some ideas better than mine and was happy that those got
voted to the top. In hindsight, I should&#8217;ve proposed the topic of &#8220;Why
Are You Not Innovating?&#8221;. I did an internal presentation on this topic
at Cisco and it was generally praised by my colleagues.</p>

<p>My other observation is, between technical and soft-skill related
topics, I liked the soft-skill ones better. For example, I found the topics on hiring,
choosing a technical vs. managerial career path to be more interesting than
the topics such as GraphQL and ReactJS. A few years ago, I&#8217;d
just choose the technical topics without thinking twice. This is also a
pattern in my recent blog posts or reading list.</p>

<p>In the hiring session, I saw a positive attitude towards hiring remotes
and treating them as equals. This is a major mindset shift among the
community.</p>

<p>In the individual contributor vs. management career path session, the
attendee list included both kinds as well as people that had transitioned in either
direction. The one take home message I got from this session was, when
confused with career choice, individual contributors and managers should take the step to
switch roles. And if things don&#8217;t work out, it&#8217;s totally possible
to revert later.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to the 2020 edition of this event and may even prepare to
come up with a good idea for the unconference. If you can, please
join us for the next round.</p>
