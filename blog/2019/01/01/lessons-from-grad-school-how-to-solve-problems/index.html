<blockquote><p>Most problems are solved inefficiently. Innovation follows when a problem is researched first.</p></blockquote>

<p>I spent a fair amount of time in grad school. First, sixteen months on my MSc, and then another forty eight months on my PhD program. Also, I worked as a pro software engineer for 20 hours/week during my MSc days and then full-time during the PhD days. It was quite an undertaking, but I survived and now claiming my bragging rights :-)</p>

<p>This post is about a general problem-solving approach that I internalized as the most valuable lesson from my grad school days. I hope you find it useful.
I&#8217;ll try and explain the concept using a personal story. Here you go.</p>

<p>Recently, I was discussing plans for the near future with my wife, Shahana. She&#8217;s an engineer. In the past, Shahana worked in the telecom industry as a network planner for a few years. Then, she decided to take an extended maternity leave to stay with our two little kids, Shopoth and Shera. Now, honestly, she&#8217;s had enough and seriously contemplating a return to work. Except, she&#8217;s unsure about what career to choose that she&#8217;d really enjoy.</p>

<p>Given this vague problem of finding a new career, she felt lost for a while. As a true supportive husband, I decided to be her man and gave her an earful!</p>

<p>Silly jokes apart, we decided to set the <strong>context</strong> first by asking and answering the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Why</strong> is she looking for a new career?</li>
<li><strong>Why not</strong> remain in the old career?</li>
<li><strong>What</strong> new career options exist?</li>
<li><strong>Where</strong> are the opportunities?</li>
<li><strong>Who</strong> knows more about those?</li>
<li><strong>How</strong> does she get a job in the preferred area?</li>
</ol>


<p>After spending a few days of research, she developed a very clear <strong>understanding of the problem</strong> and the initial vagueness of the situation was mostly wiped clean resulting in a few clear <strong>constraints</strong>. From a job portal, Shahana then <strong>listed available</strong> job requirements from a number of open positions matching her criteria. After consolidation of the requirements, the <strong>gap</strong> was clear. It was obvious that she&#8217;d need to <strong>develop essential new</strong> skills to qualify for the jobs. As she acquires the new skills, she already knows the <strong>evaluation</strong>. If this doesn&#8217;t work, she can <strong>repeat</strong> the same process to either <strong>improve</strong> her chances or choose an <strong>alternate</strong> career path entirely.</p>

<p>This was a direct application of the problem-solving framework that I learned from grad school. Here&#8217;s a nerdy version of the framework:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>  Given a problem
</span><span class='line'>    1. Ask the Wh questions -&gt; list constraints
</span><span class='line'>    2. Research -&gt; list existing solutions
</span><span class='line'>    3. Is the problem already solved? -&gt; If yes, stop
</span><span class='line'>    4. Innovate, fill in the gaps.
</span><span class='line'>    5. Evaluate</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In real life, most problems are deceptive. We think we already know the best solution based on our past experience and go straight to #4 leaving all other parts out. Even if going straight to #4 is actually a wise move, it only becomes an innovation with a tiny impact, as it doesn&#8217;t become available at step 3 for others to leverage.</p>

<p>A large number of problems can be solved at step 3, by leveraging a solution or a mix of multiple solutions that already exist. Even when problems get past step 3, it&#8217;s highly likely that the gap is smaller than the extent of the whole problem. So, an innovation can focus only on solving the gap, which offers speed and intelligent reuse.</p>

<p>This post is so prosaic already. But if you&#8217;re still with me, I&#8217;ll make it even more textbook like by giving you a couple of practice problems. Go ahead and apply my 5-step problem solving approach:</p>

<ol>
<li>Jane is a musician, a prodigy so to speak. She&#8217;s been invited to talk about music as a therapy. She&#8217;s not good at speaking, but this is a big opportunity. What does she do?</li>
<li>Mike is a young startup CEO. He&#8217;s very good at business and technology. He needs a lawyer to take care of the legal matters. How does he hire the best lawyer possible?</li>
</ol>
