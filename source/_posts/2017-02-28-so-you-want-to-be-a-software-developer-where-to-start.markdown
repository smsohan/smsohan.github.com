You didn't go to college to study computer science and you have no
background on computer programming. You're not quite happy with your
current job area, and looking forward to something more rewarding and
exciting. You've heard software development is generally a good area
and often times people without any prior software background can
actually get a job. But where do you start?

First, you're thinking in the right direction, and I can assure you that
if you like making things and have a nack for problem-solving, you can
learn the skills to become a programmer. Now, let me share a path
forward from here:

1. **Take an online course and learn a programming language**. I'd
suggest learning the programming language Ruby, using the courses
offered by [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/learn/ruby)

2. **Build a demo application**. Here's an idea: Make an app for
   tracking personal expenses so that you can enter all your expenses
and see reports about your expenses on a weekly / bi-weekly / monthly
basis by type of expense such as food, transportation, accommodation,
utility etc.

3. **Publish the application to the internet**. Use Heroku to pubish
   your app to the internet and use it for yourself. When things don't
work as expected, fix bugs or extend the application to better serve
your needs. 

I'd say spend about **6 months** on the steps 1-3. Once you've an
application that you're somewhat proud to show to your friends or
prospective employees, it's a sign that you're progessing. But don't
apply for jobs just yet. I'd suggest spending another 6 months to learn
a few more fundamental programming topics:

1. **Algorithms**: Take an online course on basic algorithms to understand
   the different types of algorithmic approaches that can be used to
solve known problems.
2. **Data structures**: Take an online course on data structures since you'll
   need to use them on a daily basis and this is one of those topics
where it'll be hard to learn on the job from no prior background.
3. **Object oriented concepts**: Take an online course to understand the
   fundamental concepts behind object oriented programming. It takes
years to master the concepts, but taking a course will greatly help you
to get the basics right.

If you spent a year of your free time (8-10 hours a week), you've now
acquired the basics that will be required to find a job. Obviously, you
can squeeze it in a much smaller time window if you dedicate more time
and already have some background with math / computing skills. But at a
mimimum, I think it'll take six months for most people to get there.

Now, I'd suggest you to take two bootcamps. The bootcamps are great in
two ways. First, you get to work with peers and immerse into building
something. Second, you can judge yourself against the peers to
understand where you stand against the pros and newbies. Take notes and
get ready for a second bootcamp. This time, the idea is to understand if
you've improved since the first bootcamp and able to perform better than
the first time.

After the bootcamps, if you're feeling positive, it's time to start
looking for jobs. Make sure to find a job that matches your skills and
keep an open mind about accepting a job that may not pay top dollars
yet. If you find a job, and you'll, go ahead and take it. You'll be
learnig at a fast pace on the job, and if you're good, you'll be
rewarded accordingly either on the current job or on a new job. The idea
is to focus on learning on the job, but also off the job to learn topics
that may not be of interest on the job.

If you followed this plan, I expect you to get your first job as a
programmer in 1.5-2 years, and get profecient in 4 years. Prepare
accordingly. May be the 4 years is worth when you consider you'll be
happier and better rewarded for many more years to come.
