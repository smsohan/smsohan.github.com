This is just like another method and should be treated equally for unit testsing purpose. Here's an example that should need unit test:<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1107355.js">  </script><br />It looks simple, so testing it should be simple, too. I would only skip the default constuctors, as long as they don't do anything interesting.</div></div>

Sure, the constructors are methods too.. but they should not do anything more except internal initialization.<br /><br />I had a little habbit to put additional logic inside constructor, to be possible to write something like<br /><br />= new DoSomethingClass(x, y);<br /><br />I&#39;m getting rid of that also because of bad testability. Instead of that I write now:<br /><br />var smth = new DoSomethingClass(x, y);<br />smth.DoIt();</div>
</div>
