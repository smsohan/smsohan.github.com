The following is just an example, but you might be familiar with a similar code already:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1237981.js">  </script><br />This code used to work when the DELETE endpoint was indeed under '/blog/posts'. However, at some point a developer wants to remove the '/blog' from all the endpoints to put them directly under '/posts'! You can see, in such cases it is very hard to catch the bug that would be caused by the faulty JS code.<br /><br />Here's a quick recommendation:<br /><blockquote>Don't hardcode the URLs (or anything that is actually a server configuration) inside your JS.&nbsp;</blockquote>This is a code smell, as its duplicating code. But its also dangerous, because its hard to catch/fix these defects since they can be buried deep under an untested Javascript file. Instead feed this data from your server side code and you'll mitigate risk that way.<br /><br /></div></div></div>
