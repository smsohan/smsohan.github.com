When talking about Search Engine Optimization for your public web pages, you probably try to follow the google guidelines for search engine optimization. Its a good one to get started with. For my recent project, <a href="http://www.campzero.com/">www.campzero.com</a>, I read the document and tried to follow the steps. Today, I worked on generating sitemap for www.campzero.com using the following:<ul><li>Installed the site-map generator plugin following this link at <a href="http://aktagon.com/projects/rails/sitemap-generator">Aktagon's</a>, <a href="http://github.com/christianhellsten/sitemap-generator">github link</a></li><li>For some reason, probably because of permission issues, my plugin install didn't generate the sample sitemap.yml file for me. However, I created the config/sitemap.yml file myself and put the following contents there:</li></ul><pre class="brush: rails">domain: www.campzero.com<br />limit: 5000<br />priority: 1<br />change_frequency: weekly</pre><ul><li>Then, I put the call to the sitemap method as shown in the github documentation. </li><li>Finally, I ran the command <b>rake sitemap:gerenate</b> to generate my sitemap.xml file inside the public folder.</li><li>So far this went well with the local environment. However, when I deployed this code and ran the rake command in my staging environment, it said it was not finding any model with the sitemap method.</li><li>After some debugging, I found that the problem was with the code at the file generator.rb where they put <b>model.methods.include?('sitemap_options') </b>to see if the model contains a method named sitemap_options. But, at my staging environment, I found that this was returning false although there was this method inside the model. I changed the code to the following so that the include? check is done both for strings and symbols and it worked fine.</li></ul><pre class="brush: rails">if((model.methods.include?(:sitemap_options) || model.methods.include?('sitemap_options')) &amp;&amp; model.sitemap_options != nil)<br />models &lt;&lt; model<br />end</pre><ul><li>Now, I could generate sitemap at my staging environment.</li><li>However, soon I found another issue with deployment, as I want my sitemap file to stay between deployments. So, I had to ensure the sitemap file is generated at a shared place other than the default public folder. I did the following changes to the sitemap_generator_task.rake file:</li></ul><pre class="brush: rails">if defined?(SITEMAP_FILE_PATH)<br />SitemapGenerator::Generator.new(SITEMAP_FILE_PATH).find_models_and_generate<br />else<br />SitemapGenerator::Generator.run<br />end</pre><div><ul><li>I added the constant SITEMAP_FILE_PATH in my config/environments/staging.rb file to get it working.</li><li>Finally, I changed my deployment script to define a symlink from the public folder to the shared file path as follows:</li></ul><div><b>run "ln -s #{shared_path}/sitemap/sitemap.xml #{release_path}/public/sitemap.xml"</b></div></div></div>
