<div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">To render a list, often times we use repeated HTML elements with a similar template. For example, the search results in ebay.com is a list of divs, each containing different data in the same template. In a server side, this rendering code is somewhat similar to this:<br /><div><br /></div><script src="https://gist.github.com/1660430.js"></script><br />If you noticed, a product with it's database id = 123 will be rendered inside a div with id="product_123", and similarly div id="product_456" will contain the product with id = 456.<br /><br />With such ids, we can write JavaScript code that can extract the database id of a selected product to do interesting things, for example:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1660456.js">  </script><br />This is a useful and a common technique. However, in this era of <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#embedding-custom-non-visible-data-with-the-data-attributes">HTML5</a>, we can make use of its custom attributes feature to write a clean JavaScript event handler without the help of parsing. Here's an example:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1660524.js">  </script><br />I will never parse my HTML element Id again. What about you?</div></div>
