I know it's your phone and you can do anything you want. But may be it's worth holding back at times. There's more to life than our screens.

I'm leaving it off the hand, off the table and off the bed, in silent mode, all day long. I'm asking for permission to use it if I have to while I'm with others. Instead of spending the time with the screens, it's been very rewarding to play with my little son, with all the attention on him. My little guy sure senses the attention and you can tell it just from looking at his eyes.
