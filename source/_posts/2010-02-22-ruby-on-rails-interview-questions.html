<b>Ruby Specific Questions</b><br />The best place for learning ruby is to get started with the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/">programming-ruby</a>. It fairly covers the important bits in a very readable language. Here are a few quick questions on ruby:<br /><ol><li>What is rubygems?</li><li>What is a Symbol?</li><li>What is the difference between a Symbol and String?</li><li>What is the purpose of yield?</li><li>How do you define class variables?</li><li>How do you define instance variables?</li><li>How do you define global variables?</li><li>How can you dynamically define a method body?</li><li>What is a Range?</li><li>How can you implement method overloading?</li><li>What is the difference between '&amp;&amp;' and 'and' operators?</li><li>What is the convention for using '!' at the end of a method name?</li><li>What is a module?</li><li>What is mixin?</li><li>How will you implement a singleton pattern?</li><li>How will you implement a observer pattern?</li><li>How can you define a constant?</li><li>How can you define a custom Exception?</li><li>How can you fire a method when a module is included inside a class?</li><li>What is the default access modifier (public/protected/private) for a method?</li><li>How can you call the base class method from inside of its overriden method?</li></ol><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Rails Specific Questions</span><br />A thorough reading of the articles at&nbsp;<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails Guides</a>&nbsp;can be very useful for starters as well as a refresher for veterans. The following bunch of questions are specific to rails, in no particular order. The <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/">Pragmatic Bookshelf</a> has a fantastic book for beginners called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pragprog.com/frequently-asked-questions/ebooks">Agile Web Development Using Ruby on Rails</a>.<br /><ol><li>Define the Rails MVC implementation using an example.</li><li>What is a named scope? (or Scope in Rails 3).</li><li>Can you give an example of a class that should be inside the lib folder?</li><li>Where should you put code that is supposed to run when your application launches?</li><li>What deployment tool do you use?</li><li>How can you migrate your database schema one level down?</li><li>What is an observer?</li><li>What is a sweeper?</li><li>How can you implement caching in Rails?</li><li>What is a filter? When it is called?</li><li>How can you divide your controllers into separate modules?</li><li>What is RESTful routing?</li><li>How can you list all routes for an application?</li><li>How can you send a multi-part email?</li><li>Is it possible to embed partial views inside layouts? How?</li><li>What is the purpose of RJS?</li><li>How can you create a REST API for your application?</li><li>How can you define a new environment called 'staging'?</li><li>What is Rake?</li><li>What is Capistrano?</li><li>What is a polymorophic association?</li><li>How can you implement a polymorphic association?</li><li>What is a has and belongs to many association?</li><li>What is the difference between has_one and belongs_to?</li><li>How can you implement single table inheritance?</li><li>What is eager loading?</li><li>How can you eager load associated objects?</li><li>How can you add a custom validation on your model?</li><li>How can you implement a custom theme for your forms?</li><li>Why is fields_for used for?</li><li>What is the purpose of a helper method?</li><li>What is flash?</li><li>How can you install the missing gems that are required by your application in the simplest way?</li><li>How can you implement internationalization?</li><li>How can you show search user friendly urls instead of using only numeric ids?</li><li>How can you configure your application for different environments?</li><li>How can you instruct rails logger to ignore passwords and such fields while logging?</li></ol><br /><b>Test Frameworks</b><br />Ruby on Rails has a number of built-in and a few other third-party test frameworks. Here are a few sample questions on such frameworks:<br /><ol><li>Are you familiar with unit testing?</li><li>How does functional testing differ from unit testing?</li><li>Have you ever used a mocking framework?</li><li>Are you familiar with BDD using RSpec or Cucumber?</li><li>What is an alternative to using test fixtures?</li><li>How can you reuse part of a text fixture?</li><li>How do you specify associations in the test fixture yml files?</li></ol><br /><b>Plugins</b><br />Plugins are the principal mechanism to reuse code. The open-source community is at full-bloom when it comes about plugins. The <a href="http://railsplugins.org/plugins">Rails Plugins site</a> has a really good list of such plugins from the community.<br /><ol><li>What plugin would you recommend for user authentication and authorization?</li><li>What plugin do you use for full-text search?</li><li>How can you implement a state machine?</li><li>What is the difference between a plugin and a gem?</li><li>How can you create a plugin?</li><li>Can you please name a few useful plugins?</li><li>How can you implement a search feature that searches for multiple models?</li><li>How can you upload a flie to a server?</li></ol><br /><b>Architecture Related Questions</b><br />This questions can be from different angles like: quality, security, scalability, manageability, interoperability, reusability and all the other ilities you name! Here are a few example questions:<br /><ol><li>Is Rails scalable?</li><li>What are the key deployment challenges?</li><li>How can you safeguard a rails application from SQL injection attack?</li><li>How can you secure a rails application?</li><li>How can rails engage with a SOA platform?</li></ol><br /><b>Community Related Questions</b><br />I see a fairly large community on <a href="http://github.com/languages/Ruby">Github</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, <a href="http://railscasts.com/">RailsCasts</a>, <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/">The Riding Rails Blog</a>&nbsp;and many more. Some interviewers may want to see if you are connected to the community. The following questions may help you prepare :-)<br /><ol><li>Can you tell me a few good community resources for Rails?</li><li>Where would you reach out to get the community to answer your questions?</li><li>What's new in Rails 3.0?</li><li>Which famous applications are built using ruby on rails?</li></ol><div>I plan to polish this document on a later revision. But in the meanwhile, if you feel like contributing, you can start commenting with the answers, more questions or suggestions. I believe this will not only help people getting ready for their next Rails job, but also for everyone to see what knowledge we are missing...<br />Disclaimer: This is not a shortcut, rather its kind of a check list that may help you with an interview.</div></div>
