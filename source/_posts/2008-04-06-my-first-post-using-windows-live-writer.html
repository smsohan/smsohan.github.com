<p>I came to know about this cool writer very recently and was waiting to take a look at this editor. Now that I am writing a blog entry from this editor, I feel like its really making my life easy.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh4.google.com/sohan39/R_ibwQTK2hI/AAAAAAAAABQ/zpBUxIdQ_5o/image%5B6%5D.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="437" alt="image" src="http://lh6.google.com/sohan39/R_ibxwTK2iI/AAAAAAAAABc/_Im9V7HK5Ko/image_thumb%5B4%5D.png" width="683" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>Well, for a head start, I just hit the print screen button followed by a ctrl-V and this is what you see! It's lot more fun to edit in this editor!</p>  <p>I recommend you all to try this and also let me know if you are using an editor more cool that this :-)</p>  </div>
