Hello Dear Readers:

I just wanted to inform you that I've joined Sourcefire this morning as a Principal Software Engineer. My primary responsibility will be helping my team with Ruby on Rails and Web technology related expertise. I'm looking forward to this new role.

ThoughtWorks was a wonderful experience. In the last couple of years with ThoughtWorks, I have worked on 4 different projects, for 4 different clients and business domains from 4 different cities in North America. In a future post I would like to write about the fantastic journey, but for now I just wanted to share the news.

Hopefully, Sourcefire will be an amazing experience as well.

Thank you again for reading my blog.
