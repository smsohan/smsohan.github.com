If you are anything like me, you love using the home and end key to quickly move to the start/end of a line of text. But, in Apple MacBook Pro, there is no default home/end key! I searched the internet and found Command + Left/Right to the rescue on OS X.<br /><div>But, then I installed windows 7 on my Mac and it was nightmare to edit without the home/end keys. Today I just found that you can use<b><span style="color: red;"> fn+ Left/Right</span></b> for this purpose! Hurray! It makes my time with Microsoft office and Visual studio much happier, again :-)<br /><div><br /></div></div></div>
