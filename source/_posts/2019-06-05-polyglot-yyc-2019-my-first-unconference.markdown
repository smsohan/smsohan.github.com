This weekend I went to [Polyglot YYC 2019](https://polyglotyyc.ca).
It's a gathering of tech people from around Calgary. The event was open
to all possible topics, hence the name Polyglot.
It was the first unconference style meetup I went to and this post
is a summary of my day.

About the attendees, I don't have the official count, but I imagine there were
close to a hundred participants. Among us, quite a few
people represented the sponsor companies. The sponsors
advertised for hiring new employees, mostly software engineers. On the
other hand, I met a few people who joined this venue to talk to prospective employers.
Some of the attendees were enrolled in a coding bootcamp to switch
careers. I was quite happy to see the community praising their enthusiasm towards the bootcampers.
Moreover, I met a few regular tech meetup people after a long time. I used to go to
all tech meetups I could find in town before having kids, and I felt
great to be among the self-motivated crowd after a long break.

About the event, I was fascinated by how the unconference took its shape.
At check-in time, everyone got a couple of forms to write down topics
of interest, either as a host or a participant. Everyone could vote for five
such topics. I didn't prepare
beforehand. So, I put up a topic that I'm presently curios about, "Writing for Developers".
A handful of people voted for me, but it didn't make the cut. I found
some ideas better than mine and was happy that those got
voted to the top. In hindsight, I should've proposed the topic of "Why
Are You Not Innovating?". I did an internal presentation on this topic
at Cisco and it was generally praised by my colleagues.

My other observation is, between technical and soft-skill related
topics, I liked the soft-skills ones better. For example, I found the topics on hiring,
choosing a technical vs. managerial career path more interesting than
the topics such as GraphQL and ReactJS. A few years ago, I would
march along the technical topics without thinking twice. This is also a
pattern in my recent blog posts or reading list.

In the hiring session, I saw a positive attitude towards hiring remotes
and treating them as equals. This is major mindset shift among the
community.

In the individual contributor vs. management career path session, the
attendee list included both kinds as well as people that had transitioned in either
direction. The one take home message I got from this session was, when
confused with career choice, individual contributors and managers should take the step to
switch roles. And if things don't work out, it's totally possible
to revert later.

I'm looking forward to the 2020 edition of this event and may be even prepare to
come up with a good idea for the unconference. If you can join, please
join us for the next round.
