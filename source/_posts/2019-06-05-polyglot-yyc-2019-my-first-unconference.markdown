This weekend I went to [Polyglot YYC 2019](https://polyglotyyc.ca). It
was the first unconference style meetup I went to and wanted to
summarize my day in this post.

At check-in time, I got a couple of forms to share topic ideas that I
was interested in either hosting or taking part in. I didn't prepare
beforehand, so just put down a group discussion topic that I'm currently interested on. "Writing for Developers", with
a synopsis of "Let's share ideas of bringing the craft of writing into
software engineering".

Thank you to the couple of people that voted for me. But, I found quite
a few promising ideas better than mine and was happy that those got
voted to the top.

My first observation is, a large number of participants were working for
the event sponsor firms. They made it obvious that all of them
sponsored with the aim of attracting people that joined this conference.
For people that are looking for interesting work opportunities, this
event was an excellent opportunity to make some connections.

Among the participants, I meet a few people that are in the middle of a
career switch. They are both going through a bootcamp program to learn
coding skills and in general the prospective employers were all very
supportive of these training programs. I was pleased to see this
openness among the community to welcome enthusiastic new comers into the profession
of software engineerings.

My other observation is, I liked the topics around leadership more than
specific technical ones. For example, I found the topics on hiring,
choosing a technical vs. managerial career path more interesting than
the topics on GraphQL, React, etc. In retrospect, I think this is a
change of personal interest over the years. A few years ago, I would
march along the technical topics without thinking twice.

Before I had kids, I used to take part in every local tech meetup I could find.
Polyglot YYC was my first local meetup in three years. I felt quite
energized to see some familiar faces as well as meet new people. The
organizers did a great job all around. I hope to go to the 2020 edition
of this event and spread the word to my community. For anyone looking
for a decent tech meetup in Calgary, I'd definitely recommend Polyglot
YYC.
