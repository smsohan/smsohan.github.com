<p>Please read this article to find out an interesting way to write unit tests on your events.</p>  <p><a title="http://www.dotnettoad.com/index.php?/archives/12-unit-testing-events.html" href="http://www.dotnettoad.com/index.php?/archives/12-unit-testing-events.html">http://www.dotnettoad.com/index.php?/archives/12-unit-testing-events.html</a></p>  <p>Unit testing has always seemed rather easy and annoying to most of the people who are new to test driven development for the reason because there is not much room for coding other than the Assert methods. Yet, I have found that people actually starts finding it cool once they have written some test codes and stuck at a point where it offers the 'Challenge' to really write a clean and concise test code.</p>  <p>Happy Unit Testing Fellas!</p></div>
