Today I have appeared at the MCTS Exam # 70-528 (Web Based Client Development) and successfully passed the exam. I also appeared at another exam # 70-536 (Microsoft .Net Framework) and successfully passed in that exam too.<br /><br />Although, I haven't got the MCP website access information yet, I can now possibly be called a 'Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist'!</div>
