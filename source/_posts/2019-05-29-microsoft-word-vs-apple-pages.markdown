Showing a Screenshot of Microsoft Word for Mac and Apple Pages

This is what you get by default when you open a blank document on both editors.
I love that Apple Pages puts a deep focus on the content. If you haven't used it, I'd
recommend trying it out. I know Microsoft Word has a known face, so
you're likely used to all the distractions that sorrounds the content.
But, if you can, give Apple Pages a try.
