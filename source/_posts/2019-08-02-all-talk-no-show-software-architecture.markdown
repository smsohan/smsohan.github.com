We have a problem with software architecture. Let's face it. Find the architecture diagrams of the products you're working on and answer these questions:

1. Did you find it?
2. Does everyone in your team know where to find it?
3. Is it up-to-date?
4. Can you see how this system scales, handles failover, monitors performance, or how it's secured?
5. Can you see how it evolved over time?
6. Can you train a new team-member using this diagram?

This is the first micro-post of a series of such as I aim to build a compelling case for fundamentally changing software architecture diagrams.
