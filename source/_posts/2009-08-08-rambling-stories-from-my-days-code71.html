<p>Sighs!</p>  <p>Back then, on Friday, May 26, 2006, I was a final year undergrad student at <a href="http://www.buet.ac.bd/cse">CSE, BUET</a>. I was looking for a part-time software dev job opportunity and found a little one page advert for a student job at asha-technologies (lately renamed as <a href="http://code71.com/" target="_blank">Code71</a>). Visited their website and thought it might be worth giving a try!</p>  <p>As usual, I was interviewed over phone and enjoyed a long 2 hour interview on premise. I found it really inspiring and gained more interest towards the job after this session. I started waiting for a response… but was pretty certain about a positive one!</p>  <p>Good things happen in quick successions in our lives. Agree?</p>  <p>I agree. Because I just started a soul-journey with my soul-mate, Shahana, on the March of 2006. Then got the job offer on the 26th of May! Couldn’t be happier. A job for me during that time was just beyond its compensation, it was an inspiration, opportunity to see the real world and being part of something bigger than myself.</p>  <p><img height="214" src="http://photos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v3755/201/25/559702037/n559702037_2367230_3471408.jpg" width="222" /></p>  <p><em>Photo taken at Chhera dip (The Torn Island), St. Martins, Bangladesh. The last photograph taken with my first digital camera bought from my first month’s Salary!</em></p>  <p>I started my job on the 1st of June, 2006 at Asha-technologies. Asha-tech was still to find an office and <a href="http://syedraihan.com/" target="_blank">Omar</a> asked to meet him at his home office! That’s how it all started. We met a few times a week at Omar’s home until we moved to our office at the green building of green square at green road, Dhaka on the first of July.</p>  <p>Asha-tech signed up a client before it was even formed! So, once we moved into the office, we were building our first asha-tech product, an online loan financing gateway. We were enthusiastic about agile scrum/xp practices from the first day at office. The result was found in just less than 3 months. We rolled out our first release of the product. It was really a happy start. A fantastic start for a start-up. The client started generating revenue in less than 3 months of project inception!</p>  <p>The office setup was a small but adequate enough for our team. We installed long backup UPS (2 hours * 5 computers), A/C, IPS and dedicated internet connection with Wi-Fi. The work environment was full of fun. We were going for an outing to a team event every month and even more often going to delicious buffet places. We played table football and bowling… every time had a record breaking score and a new winner. We went swimming and believe me, <a href="http://syedraihan.com/" target="_blank">Omar</a> is as good a swimmer as he is a master in software technology. He would go to swimming with a flipper and flip like professional swimmers. He can even swim without using his hands/legs at all, lying side-on and in all such actions… I learned swimming keeping heads down and the easy way of breathing from him! Thanks!</p>  <p>Technologically we were maturing as well. Started using XPlanner for managing our project, attended daily standup meetings and started doing TDD. I won’t claim we got everything right at the first try… but, we were trying consistently, improving bit by bit… to this day.</p>  <p>For the most part, I was enjoying my job and became used to the pressure of a job + undergraduate studies. I said, good things happen in close succession. Another proof here! My first term final result with this job was a 4.0/4.0. I never scored 4.0 in a term before this nor had a 20+ hour/week job alongside my studies. </p>  <p>I strongly believe, my job taught me the attitude towards work, “plan, act and retrospect”. After over three years, I would suggest any new entrant in the software industry to start a career with passion. Its fun with passion. Its a win everyday with passion.</p></div>
