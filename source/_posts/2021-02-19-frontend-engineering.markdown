In my current role at Microsoft, I'm working on a UI SDK product. I
hear this concern from some of my team members. More specifically,
here's a paraphrased version of what I hear:

> "I talked to my friends in software and they told me it's better to work
> on the backend or full-stack to have a fast-tracked career."

First, I do agree that there are generally more full-stack or backend
engineering jobs than purely frontend jobs. I also agree that there's a
general perception that frontend is easy / bunch of scripts / not real
engineering, yada yada...

However, I think it's a short-sighted view. Let me make my point here.

**Let's imagine the UI and UX of a familiar product, Google Maps.** You can
use Google Maps on your browser or natively on the phone. You can embed
Google Maps within your own app on these platforms as well. You can ask
Google Maps to give you navigation direction for walking, biking,
driving, or ask it show realtime transit and traffic infomation. If you
take a detour, it'll show you new directions on the fly. You can see the
map view, or the 3D view, or a camera view of a location. At night, you
can see the dark-mode. It'll show you how many lanes you have on a road,
and how fast you can legally go, in realtime. It'll let you share your location in
realtime with your buddy. You can search using your voice and it'll also 
give you turn by turn voice guidance. Let's not mention avoiding
toll-free roads, u-turns, etc.

**I hope you see the engineering challenge I see in the above
paragraph.**
Very few engineers I know can architect a system such as Google Maps.
Since a lot of the engineers choose the path of backend engineering,
it's incredibly hard to find frontend engineers who can pull high impact
projects. If you consider yourself above
average, and you probably are if you're reading this blog, you should
not follow the path of the average. Instead, if you like building visual
products and obsessing about delighting millions or billions of users,
you can have a very rewarding and fast-paced career in frontend
engineering.

Modern frontend engineering is complex, but it's powered by sleek
tools. Most of the tooling is open-source and the community is
vibrant with lots of conferences and meetups around the world. As a
highly impactful frontend engineer, you can truly
differentiate yourself from the masses.
