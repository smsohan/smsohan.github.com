<p>Being over-burdened by all the blog posts on MVC from the ASP.Net for the last few months, I am now looking to ASP.Net MVC. Still seeing the tutorials on <a href="http://asp.net/mvc" target="_blank">asp.net/mvc</a> site.</p>  <p>I have worked on a few rails projects and the ASP.Net MVC implementation is very much like Rails. Anyway, still early for me to comment!</p></div>

@Tanvir,<BR/>Yes, I read the first chapter. My finding is ASP.Net MVC is still far from being real! The implementation of AJAX does not seem to be smart yet.<BR/>I would like to wait and see if the community really takes this framework in the coming days.</div>

There is also a short book by ScottGu's on MVC. You may find the download link from his blog.</div>
