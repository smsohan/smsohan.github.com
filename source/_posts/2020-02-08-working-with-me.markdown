Since I commonly work with a diverse group of people, this post is a way for me to broadcast some quick tricks that may help our working relationship. When we work together, let's do this:

__Trust__ is only earned when it's mutual. Let's work with this shared belief.

__Context__ is everything. Most importantly, show me __why__ we need to work on something. If the answer isn't clear in your mind, we can work together to build a crisp context.

__Solutions__ for problems you're raising. Ideally, you've already thought about a few solutions with some measure of feasibility for each, and you come with an open mind. I know you care about the problem only if you spent some time thinking about a few solutions.

__Clarity__ between your evidence and assumptions. Assumptions are often essential to move ahead, but treating assumptions as evidence can be harmful.

__Output__ is the focus, our egos aren't. That said, let's be mutually respectful.

__Time__ is managed. Let's manage our expectations given the time we have. Blaming the shortage of time shows a lack of skill.

__Writing__ is a great thought exercise and good write-up scales infinitely. Let's write and rewrite our thoughts, specially when we're unclear about those.

__Standup comedies, biography, soccer, politics, investment, tech, leadership, Netflix, movies, and similar topics__ are cool. Sorry, not much of a Hockey or Basket Ball fan. Mostly a passive music listener and happy to listen whatever is on radio or a YouTube playlist.

If you have a similar list, I'd be happy to read and respect it. Please send along.
