Since I commonly work with a diverse group of people, this post is a way for me to broadcast some quick tricks that may help our working relationship. When we work together, let's do this:

__Trust__ is only earned when it's mutual. Let's work with this shared belief.

__Context__ is everything. Most importantly, show me __why__ we need to work on something. If the answer isn't clear in your mind, we can work together to build a crisp context.

__Solutions__ for problems you're raising to help me respect your commitment. Ideally, you have thought about a few solutions with some measure of feasibility for each, and you come with an open mind to accept different ideas.

__Clarity__ in your evidence or explicitly calling out your assumptions. Assumptions are often essential to move ahead, but treating assumptions as evidence can be harmful.

__Output__ is the focus, our egos are not. That said, let's be mutually respectful.

__Time__ is managed. Let's find a way so that our expectations and time management are aligned instead of blaming the shortage of time.

__Writing__ is a great thought exercise and good write-up scales infinitely. Let's write and rewrite our thoughts, specially when we feel unsure about those.
