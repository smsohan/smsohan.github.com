<div class='post'>
<p>I am really really happy to see people putting so much efforts for building high quality, nearly all avoidable error free software. I am a big believer of Test Driven Development and doing TDD for about two years now. I have always had the feeling that TDD is a kind of a misnomer because to some people the term 'Test' refers to finding bugs. For this very reason, when people gets started with TDD, they consider it as a waste of time to write so much extra code that doesn't necessarily find bugs!</p>  <p>Well, a good vocabulary always makes it more attractive and useful. Now with BDD, Behavior Driven Development, I think the vocabulary that people actually codes the behaviors and implements the behaviors, not the tests, makes it more like it.</p>  <p>So, lets see my first ever written RSpec ruby code and the sexy html output!</p>  <p>#This is a poor Stack implementation</p>  <p><span style="color:#404040;">class</span> Stack   <br />   <span style="color:#404040;">def</span> initialize   <br />       @items = []   <br />   end   <br />   def push(item)   <br />       @items &lt;&lt; item   <br />   end   <br />   def pop   <br />       return nil unless @items &amp;&amp; @items.length &gt; 0   <br />       item = @items.last   <br />       @items.delete item   <br />       return item   <br />   end   <br />   def peek   <br />       return nil unless @items &amp;&amp; @items.length &gt; 0   <br />       @items.last   <br />   end   <br />   def empty?   <br />       @items.empty?   <br />   end   <br />end</p>  <p>#This is the RSpec ruby code. Isn't is Simple?</p>  <p>describe Stack do  <br />   before(:each) do   <br />       @stack = Stack.new   <br />   end   <br />   describe "Empty" do   <br />       it "Should be empty when created" do   <br />           @stack.empty?.should == true   <br />       end   <br />   end   <br />   describe "With One Item (value = 3)" do   <br />       before(:each) do   <br />           @stack.push(3)   <br />       end   <br />       it "should not be empty" do   <br />           @stack.empty?.should be_false   <br />       end   <br />       it "should return the item (=3) when #peek" do   <br />           @stack.peek.should == 3   <br />       end   <br />       it "should return the item (=3) when #pop" do   <br />           @stack.pop.should == 3   <br />       end   <br />   end   <br />end</p>  <p>Well, we all write codes and are doing this day and night for years. What I like to see is as sexy an output as the following from my source code :-)</p>  <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/sohan39/SLu558pW0rI/AAAAAAAAAD8/1nk1GLN_mBM/s1600-h/RSpec%5B12%5D.jpg"><img style="border: 0px none ;" alt="RSpec" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/sohan39/SLu57kNJhoI/AAAAAAAAAEA/ZIjSLFPkOOk/RSpec_thumb%5B8%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="812" border="0" height="244" /></a> </p>  <p>I know, you liked the output. For more you may check at <a title="http://rspec.info/" href="http://rspec.info/">http://rspec.info/</a></p>  <p>Need a similar solution on .Net? Keep Googling and come back to me if you see a good BDD tool. I would really like to use BDD in my .Net projects and see how better it performs over TDD. </p></div>
