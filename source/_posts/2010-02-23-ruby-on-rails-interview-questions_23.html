In my previous post, I listed a few <a href="http://smsohan.blogspot.com/2010/02/ruby-on-rails-interview-questions.html">general interview questions for Ruby on Rails</a> jobs. This one is intended to be more of an advanced level, not for the rookies :-)<br /><br /><ol><li>What is Rack?</li><li>Sketch out a deployment architecture of a Ruby on Rails application utilizing multiple servers.</li><li>How can you secure a rails application to counter for Session Fixation?</li><li>Where can I get the core rails framework source code?</li><li>How can you reuse the models from one rails project into another?</li><li>Explain one plugin that you extracted out of your source code.</li><li>What is the difference between pre-initializers and initializers?</li><li>How can you easily switch your logger to use Log4r?</li><li>How would you design the logging standard for your rails application?</li><li>How can you implement asynchronous messaging in Rails?</li><li>What will you do to look for a possible memory leak in Rails application?</li><li>How can you run a profiler?</li><li>What is lambda?</li><li>What is Proc? When did you use this?</li><li>How can you use before and after callbacks of your rails methods to halt a database insert/update/delete?</li><li>How can you reuse your before and after callback methods across multiple models?</li><li>Define an architecture to store files uploaded to an application so that they are only accessible to valid users.</li><li>How would you change your asset storage to use a static server?</li><li>Explain one situation when you used rails caching.</li><li>What kinds of caching comes in-built with Rails?</li><li>Can you explain the use of 'dynamic' features of Ruby on the core Rails framework?</li><li>How can you call a SOAP web service from a rails application?</li><li>Your application needs to send a lot of email notifications. How would you design the notification so that the end user doesn't get stuck for email sending delays?</li><li>What is a mongrel cluster?</li><li>Can you explain if the clusters share a same memory? Can one cluster handle a request from a client that was handled by another?</li><li>How would you internationalize your application interface?</li><li>How can you create a rails generator?</li><li>Have you ever used a polymorphic association?</li><li>How can you define a plugin that adds a new class method to ActiveRecord::Base?</li><li>What are the three most significant changes in Rails 3 in your eyes?</li><li>How can you implement complex reporting using ruby on rails?</li></ol><div>I am sure this list will go on and on. But I have found most people asking questions about scalability, deployment issues, security and such architectural level questions to extract out the in-depth understanding of such core concepts. Where to learn more on such advanced stuffs?&nbsp;<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails Guides</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ruby-on-rails">Stack Overflow</a> are my favorite places. However, its good to keep an eye on the edge rails to see what's happening today!&nbsp;</div></div>
