When talking to people, I'm always interested to know how they learn. This image above shows a view of how I personally learn. Here's some context about the items on the diagram:

1. Online-courses: I love O'Reilly learning. Their video courses are split into 5 minute lectures. For example, I took their Kotlin course to learn the language.
2. Books: Books are great for curated content, but it takes dedicated time. Most of the time, I have one book that I read. Current interest is on leadership and business.
3. Hands-on: A lot of people learn by doing. I do the same, but mostly at a hello world level instead of going too deep into new things.
4. Podcasts: This is my most passive form of learning, mostly when I'm walking or driving.
5. People: I keep in touch with people and ask them about what they are learning. 
6. Twitter: I admit, I spend too much time on Twitter. But occasionally, people share interesting things.
7. YouTube videos: I watch conference talks such as InfoQ, DotNet, Rails, Ruby, Goto, and AWS.
8. News: I follow Hacker News mostly for tech and business news. And then there's following stock market news about new business innovations.
9. Interviews: I watch inteview shows on YouTube as I'm a big fan of biographical content.
10. Open-source: I follow a bunch of open-source projects or just read code from time to time to learn about how the passionate and expert developers craft code.
