<div class='post'>
Recently, I had the following requirements as I was working on CampZero.com - the going to be service marketplace of Bangladesh.<div><ol><li>Remove all html tags other than hyperlinks and new lines from a html fragment</li><li>Truncate the text to show only first 200 characters of the text and append ellipsis (...) in case the text was truncated.</li><li>Highlight an array of words in the text to show the search query worlds that matched</li></ol><div>The first one, getting rid of all but hyperlinks and new lines was achieved by the following code:</div><pre class="brush: rails"><br />&lt;%= sanitize my_html_text, :tags => %w(br a) %&gt;<br /></pre><div>Next, to truncate the text, I simply used the following:</div><div><pre class="brush: rails"><br />&lt;%= truncate my_sanitized_text, :length => 200 %&gt;<br /></pre></div><div>Lastly, to highlight my search query words, I did the following</div><pre class="brush: rails"><br />#in the controller<br />@query_words = params[:query] ? params[:query].split(/\W/) : ''<br />#in the view</pre></div><div><div>In reality, I chained the above thee methods as shown below:</div><div><pre class="brush: rails">&lt;%= highlight(truncate(sanitize(my_html_text, :tags => %w(br a)), :length => 200), @query_words) %&gt;</pre></div><div>These methods and their siblings are great as time savers. Rails makes the web development fun by including this as built in methods.
