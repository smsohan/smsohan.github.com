This is good in two ways: a) It helps people to find path to move up the navigation stack and b) it helps the google and other search engines to get a feel about your web content's hierarchical organization.<div>To add this breadcrumbs support, in my application <a href="http://www.campzero.com/">www.campzero.com</a>, a going to be online service marketplace for Bangladesh, I simply used the Crummy plugin.
