<p>For a few days, I have been trying a lot to understand why people would be using RESTful instead of the standard SOAP based Web Services. I thought, I could better understand by building one little RESTfully architected application myself.</p>  <p>After a few google searches, I found that WCF has some attribute based programming support for implementing a RESTful architecture. MSDN has a good document on the whole WebGet and WebInvoke attributes. However, the article on <a title="http://blogs.conchango.com/anthonysteele/archive/2008/03/15/rest-from-wcf-3-5.aspx" href="http://blogs.conchango.com/anthonysteele/archive/2008/03/15/rest-from-wcf-3-5.aspx">http://blogs.conchango.com/anthonysteele/archive/2008/03/15/rest-from-wcf-3-5.aspx</a> shows nearly the simplest implementation of a mini RESTful architecture. I think, one might take a look at the article and get a good head-start!</p></div>
