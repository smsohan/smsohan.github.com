This is a much shorter new year post. 2014 was the year of focusing on health, soft-skills, Haskell, social contribution and PhD in addition to typical everyday stuff. Hoping 2015 will be the year of:

> reconnecting with friends and relatives

> perfection

While Facebook and Twitter make it easy to browse through my friends' photos and status updates, I feel quite reluctant to interact on these media. Also, this passive mode of keeping in touch sucks, since my friends are largely unaware of the fact that I still care. So, 2015 will be the year when I regularly call people, and talk to them on the phone/skype/in person.

Perfection. On most occasions I'm happy if something I tried yielded just enough. 2015, I'll strive for perfection beyond just enough.

Wishing everyone a joyful 2015, Happy new year.
