<p>I loved Ninject because</p>  <p>- I don't love to write/edit XML documents myself.</p>  <p>- I think Ninject can save a lot of coding and debugging time.</p>  <p>- This is a cool framework :-) with a fun-to-read documentation.</p>  <p>- It uses simple conventions and Attributes for resolving most dependencies behind the scene.</p>  <p>- You can take full advantage to lambda expressions for writing compact codes.</p>  <p>Today, I took a look into this Ninject framework. I have used Spring.Net and Unity in my previous and current projects. But seems like Ninject has the most 'fluent vocabulary' that lets you develop on most 'fluent interfaces'.</p>  <p>Take a look at the fun-to-read documentation at <a title="http://dojo.ninject.org/wiki/display/NINJECT/Home" href="http://dojo.ninject.org/wiki/display/NINJECT/Home">http://dojo.ninject.org/wiki/display/NINJECT/Home</a> and enjoy the 20 minutes while you eat the whole document!</p></div>
