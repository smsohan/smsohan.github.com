MvcMailer makes me happy as a developer.

I find an immense amount of happiness everytime I check the [Nuget page of MvcMailer](https://nuget.org/packages/MvcMailer/). It's so refreshing to see the download count going up (42,427 total downloads as I write), receiving feedback, praises and even the complains.

The idea of MvcMailer came from trying to bring some of the amazing [Ruby on Rails ActionMailer](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html) features to ASP.NET MVC developers. It was well accepted since the very beginning and I hope is still helping people. As a side-effect, MvcMailer gives me an opportunity to keep in touch with the developments in ASP.NET MVC, C#, the .NET framework and the community around these. During our Sunday coffee and code seessions, I usually pair up with [Tyler Mercier](http://codecuriosity.com/), and MvcMailer is often the project we'd work on, or at least talk about. It also gives me a code to share on my [github profile](https://github.com/smsohan/MvcMailer), which I expect a good future employer to care about :)

Yesterday, we met for Coffee and Code and released a new version to better work with .NET 4.5. This has been the most requested feature in the last couple months and required a small code change. After we released it, I drove home in about 20 minutes. Checked the counts, and it had already seen 4 downloads. This felt just amazing. Now after about 20 hours, it feels even better to see 100+ downloads of the new release. It feels so good.

Open source is truly rewarding, both to its contributors and to its consumers.

Happy open sourcing.
