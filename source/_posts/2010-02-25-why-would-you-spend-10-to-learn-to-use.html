This is sounding very strange to me indeed! 37Signals is very much known for creating the simplest of interfaces and I really found people finding it very intuitive. But this is strange... now they are asking people to buy a book for $10 to learn how to use Basecamp! Can you believe it? See the sales post (!) here at&nbsp;<a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/typepad/37signals/products/~3/jK7OxAFFZ84/sams-teach-yourself-basecamp-in-10-minutes-is-a-comprehensive-guide-to-basecamp.html">"Sams Teach Yourself Basecamp in 10 Minutes" is a comprehensive guide to Basecamp</a></div>

Hi Ashic, thanks for stopping by!<br />They claim to have 3 million users on Basecamp. I think $20K is not something that makes them any richer!<br />In fact I would think it gives a wrong signal, like you need to learn by reading a book to use Basecamp, what people seem to know anyways!</div>
