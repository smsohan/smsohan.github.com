Most people eventually come across a time when they'd need to provide
names of colleagues as references while applying for a new job. The
referees are often involved in the last stage of the hiring process,
when the employer is generally satisfied that the candidate is a
potential hire. At this stage, the employer expects to find a few
things:

1. **Verification of facts.** The employer wants to confirm the validity of
   the information such as the role, responsibilities, and achievements
   provided by the candidate about their past experience.
2. **Qualitative feedback.** The employer wants to understand the "cultural
   fitness" aspect of the candidate by asking questions related to the
   individual's interaction and collaboration skills.

While these are valid goals, I personally find the practice of using
references to achieve these goals to be a rather flawed one. Here's why:

1. **References aren't replacements for interviews.** As an employer,
   the responsibility is on the employer to be smart enough to verify
   that the skills and experiences as advertised by a candidate's resume
   reflect the reality. If the employer can't do that with a reasonable
   amount of confidence, they're likely to hire wrong candidates anyway.
2. **Likely outdated.** If a candidate is currently employed, due to the
   secret nature of most job searches, they are unlikely to use one of
   their coworkers as the referee. As a result, the longer a candidate
   is employed by the most recent employer, the more outdated the
   references tend to get.
3. **Likely tampered.** If a candidate wants to use a referee, they'd
   generally contact ahead of time with the referee. Even if they don't
   contact, the candidates are likely to mention names of people that
   are almost certain to say good things about them. For any qualitative
   feedback, this setup limits the possibility of getting any negative
   traits of a candidate.
4. **Open to interpretation.** Reference checks are often done over
   phone. Also, the person calling to check the reference often hasn't met the
   candidate during the interview steps. This creates a double-blindness
   of sort. So, anything said during the reference check process suffers
   from possibilities of information gap.

 In my opinion, if reference checks are used, they should only be used
 to verify factual information. That too, should be done keeping in mind
 that the information may be outdated, or intentionally biased.
