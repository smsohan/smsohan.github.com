One benefit of working at Cisco is access to the many learning and development resources. Our learning and development org arranges hundreds of courses throughout the year. Moreover, we have a reimbursement program for external courses, conferences, books, and subscriptions to online learning programs and publications.

In past 6 years, I have immensely benefitted from these resources. Here's a list of the learning resources I've used.

1. [Safari books online](https://learning.oreilly.com), aka O'Reilly learning: In the past 3 years, have taken 3 online trainings and 7 books on this platform so far.
2. Design thinking, 2019: A two-day course taught by consultants about how to apply the principles of design thinking to communicate and derive solutions to complex problems.
3. Mindfulness, 2019: A 5-week program taught by consultants, with one hour in each week, where I learned about staying mindful and effective at work amid all the chaos that surrounds it.
4. [Tufte one-day course](http://tufte.com), 2019: Attended a course taught by Edward Tufte on data visualization and learned about the principles that make compelling data visualization.
5. [SANS incident response](https://www.sans.org/course/hacker-techniques-exploits-incident-handling), 2018: A packed week-long program where I learned to think like a hacker by learning about and then hacking some interesting vulnerabilities in systems.
6. [Cisco R00tcamp](https://dcloud-cms.cisco.com/demo_news/cisco-r00tcamp-lab-v1), 2017: A packed week-long program where I learned hands-on pen-testing techniques to build more secure software.
7. [Cisco threat-hunting](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/threat-hunting-workshop.html), 2017: A daylong course to find root case that triggered a security threat using integrated Cisco tools, including the product I build with our team.
7. [RailsConf](https://www.railsconf.com/2015/), 2015: It was a big opportunity to meet the community and bring some of their practices in-house. For example, we started using [BugSnag](https://www.bugsnag.com) after learning about it in the conference.
