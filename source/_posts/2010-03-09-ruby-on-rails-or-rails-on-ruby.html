All on a sudden, this thing popped up in my mind. What we are calling Ruby on Rails, is this actually "Ruby" on "Rails" or the other way around? Is this upside down? Here's my mental picture of the RoR framework:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/86/239456671_8eb4cc1e15.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/86/239456671_8eb4cc1e15.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Image credits to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thefoologs/">Foo Fighter</a>&nbsp;on Flickr(creative commons)</div><br /><ol><li>Ruby is a self-sustained language.

I like the way you put it :-) &quot;Rails are those things that trains moves on&quot;, taking literal meaning in this way would mean something very different for &quot;ruby&quot;!</div>

I think you&#39;ve messed it up ;). Rails isn&#39;t a framework. Ruby on Rails is. So it is not Ruby (language) on Rails (framework). Rails are those things that trains moves on. So Ruby on Rails means (at least for me) something like &quot;accelerated ruby with a lot of constrains&quot;. And this is a name of a framework. Rails on Ruby would be something like: &quot;this poor guy Ruby takes those heavy rails on his shoulders and walks in pain with it&quot;</div>
